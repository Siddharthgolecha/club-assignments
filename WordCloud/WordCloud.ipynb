This script needs to process the text, remove punctuation, ignore case and words that do not contain all alphabets, count the frequencies, and ignore uninteresting or irrelevant words. A dictionary is the output of the calculate_frequencies function. The wordcloud module will then generate the image from your dictionary.\n",

Or you can use a site like [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org) to find books that are available online. You could see what word clouds you can get from famous books, like a Shakespeare play or a novel by Jane Austen. Save this as a .txt file somewhere on your computer."

The purpose of science is to peel back the layer of the appear- \\nance of objects to reveal their underlying nature. In fact, if appearance \\nand essence were the same thing, there would be no need for science. \\n\\nPerhaps the most deeply entrenched common-sense notion about \\nour world is that it is three dimensional. It goes without saying that \\nlength, width, and breadth suffice to describe all objects in our visible \\nuniverse. Experiments with babies and animals have shown that we are \\nborn with an innate sense that our world is three dimensional. If we \\ninclude time as another dimension, then four dimensions are sufficient \\nto record all events in the universe. No matter where our instruments \\nhave probed, from deep within the atom to the farthest reaches of the \\ngalactic cluster, we have only found evidence of these four dimensions. \\nTo claim otherwise publicly, that other dimensions might exist or that \\nour universe may coexist with others, is to invite certain scorn. Yet this \\ndeeply ingrained prejudice about our world, first speculated on by \\nancient Greek philosophers 2 millennia ago, is about to succumb to the \\nprogress of science. \\n\\nThis book is about a scientific revolution created by the theory of hyper- \\nspace,\\' which states that dimensions exist beyond the commonly accepted \\nfour of space and time. There is a growing acknowledgment among \\nphysicists worldwide, including several Nobel laureates, that the universe \\nmay actually exist in higher-dimensional space. If this theory is proved \\ncorrect, it will create a profound conceptual and philosophical revolu- \\ntion in our understanding of the universe. Scientifically, the hyperspace \\ntheory goes by the names of Kaluza-Klein theory and supergravity. But \\n\\n\\n\\nPreface \\n\\n\\nviii \\n\\nits most advanced formulation is called superstring theory, which even \\npredicts the precise number of dimensions: ten. The usual three dimen- \\nsions of space (length, width, and breadth) and one of time are now \\nextended by six more spatial dimensions. \\n\\nWe caution that the theory of hyperspace has not yet been experi- \\nmentally confirmed and would, in fact, be exceedingly difficult to prove \\nin the laboratory. However, the theory has already swept across the major \\nphysics research laboratories of the world and has irrevocably altered \\nthe scientific landscape of modern physics, generating a staggering num- \\nber of research papers in the scientific literature (over 5,000 by one \\ncount). However, almost nothing has been written for the lay audience \\nto explain the fascinating properties of higher-dimensional space. \\nTherefore, the general public is only dimly aware, if at all, of this revo- \\nlution. In fact, the glib references to other dimensions and parallel uni- \\nverses in the popular culture are often misleading. This is regrettable \\nbecause the theory\\'s importance lies in its power to unify all known \\nphysical phenomena in an astonishingly simple framework. This book \\nmakes available, for the first time, a scientifically authoritative but acces- \\nsible account of the current fascinating research on hyperspace. \\n\\nTo explain why the hyperspace theory has generated so much excite- \\nment within the world of theoretical physics. I have developed four fun- \\ndamental themes that run through this book like a thread. These four \\nthemes divide the book into four parts. \\n\\nIn Part I, I develop the early history of hyperspace, emphasizing the \\ntheme that the laws of nature become simpler and more elegant when \\nexpressed in higher dimensions. \\n\\nTo understand how adding higher dimensions can simplify physical \\nproblems, consider the following example: To the ancient Egyptians, \\nthe weather was a complete mystery. What caused the seasons? Why did \\nit get warmer as they traveled south? Why did the winds generally blow \\nin one direction? The weather was impossible to explain from the limited \\nvantage point of the ancient Egyptians, to whom the earth appeared flat, \\nlike a two-dimensional plane. But now imagine sending the Egyptians in \\na rocket into outer space, where they can see the earth as simple and \\nwhole in its orbit around the sun. Suddenly, the answers to these ques- \\ntions become obvious. \\n\\nFrom outer space, it is clear that the earth\\'s axis is tilted about 23 \\ndegrees from the vertical (the \\'vertical\" being the perpendicular to the \\nplane of the earth\\'s orbit around the sun). Because of this tilt, the north- \\nern hemisphere receives much less sunlight during one part of its orbit \\nthan during another part. Hence we have winter and summer. And since \\n\\n\\n\\nPreface \\n\\n\\nIX \\n\\n\\nthe equator receives more sunlight then the northern or southern polar \\nregions, it becomes warmer as we approach the equator. Similarly, since \\nthe earth spins counterclockwise to someone sitting on the north pole, \\nthe cold, polar air swerves as it moves south toward the equator. The \\nmotion of hot and cold masses of air, set in motion by the earth\\'s spin, \\nthus helps to explain why the winds generally blow in one direction, \\ndepending on where you are on the earth. \\n\\nIn summary, the rather obscure laws of the weather are easy to under- \\nstand once we view the earth from space. Thus the solution to the prob- \\nlem is to go up into space, into the third dimension. Facts that were impos- \\nsible to understand in a flat world suddenly become obvious when \\nviewing a three-dimensional earth. \\n\\nSimilarly, the laws of gravity and light seem totally dissimilar. They \\nobey different physical assumptions and different mathematics. \\nAttempts to splice these two forces have always failed. However, if we \\nadd one more dimension, a fifth dimension, to the previous four dimen- \\nsions of space and time, then the equations governing light and gravity \\nappear to merge together like two pieces of ajigsaw puzzle. Light, in \\nfact, can be explained as vibrations in the fifth dimension. In this way, \\nwe see that the laws of light and gravity become simpler in five dimen- \\nsions. \\n\\nConsequently, many physicists are now convinced that a conventional \\nfour-dimensional theory is \"too small\" to describe adequately the forces \\nthat describe our universe. In a four-dimensional theory, physicists have \\nto squeeze together the forces of nature in a clumsy, unnatural fashion. \\nFurthermore, this hybrid theory is incorrect. When expressed in dimen- \\nsions beyond four, however, we have \"enough room\" to explain the \\nfundamental forces in an elegant, self-contained fashion. \\n\\nIn Part II. we further elaborate on this simple idea, emphasizing that \\nthe hyperspace theory may be able to unify all known laws of nature into \\none theory. Thus the hyperspace theory may be the crowning achieve- \\nment of 2 millennia of scientific investigation: the unification of all \\nknown physical forces. It may give us the Holy Grail of physics, the \"the- \\nory of everything\" that eluded Einstein for so many decades. \\n\\nFor the past half-century, scientists have been puzzled as to why the \\nbasic forces that hold together the cosmos \\xe2\\x80\\x94 gravity, electromagnetism, \\nand the strong and weak nuclear forces \\xe2\\x80\\x94 differ so greatly. Attempts by \\nthe greatest minds of the twentieth century to provide a unifying picture \\nof all the known forces have failed. However, the hyperspace theory \\nallows the possibility of explaining the four forces of nature as well as \\nthe seemingly random collection of subatomic particles in a truly elegant \\n\\n\\n\\nX \\n\\n\\nPreface \\n\\n\\nfashion. In the hyperspace theory, \"matter\" can be also viewed as the \\nvibrations that ripple through the fabric of space and time. Thus follows \\nthe fascinating possibility that everything we see around us, from the \\ntrees and mountains to the stars themselves, are nothing but vibrations \\nin hyperspace. If this is true, then this gives us an elegant, simple, and \\ngeometric means of providing a coherent and compelling description \\nof the entire universe. \\n\\nIn Part III, we explore the possibility that, under extreme circum- \\nstances, space may be stretched until it rips or tears. In other words, \\nhyperspace may provide a means to tunnel through space and time. \\nAlthough we stress that this is still highly speculative, physicists are seri- \\nously analyzing the properties of \"wormholes,\" of tunnels that link dis- \\ntant parts of space and time. Physicists at the California Institute of Tech- \\nnology, for example, have seriously proposed the possibility of building \\na time machine, consisting of a wormhole that connects the past with \\nthe future. Time machines have now left the realm of speculation and \\nfantasy and have become legitimate fields of scientific research. \\n\\nCosmologists have even proposed the startling possibility that our \\nuniverse is just one among an infinite number of parallel universes. \\nThese universes might be compared to a vast collection of soap bubbles \\nsuspended in air. Normally, contact between these bubble universes is \\nimpossible, but, by analyzing Einstein\\'s equations, cosmologists have \\nshown that there might exist a web of wormholes, or tubes, that connect \\nthese parallel universes. On each bubble, we can define our own dis- \\ntinctive space and time, which have meaning only on its surface; outside \\nthese bubbles, space and time have no meaning. \\n\\nAlthough many consequences of this discussion are purely theoreti- \\ncal, hyperspace travel may eventually provide the most practical appli- \\ncation of all: to save intelligent life, including ours, from the death of \\nthe universe. Scientists universally believe that the universe must even- \\ntually die, and with it all life that has evolved over billions of years. For \\nexample, according to the prevailing theory, called the Big Bang, a cos- \\nmic explosion 15 to 20 billion years ago set the universe expanding, \\nhurling stars and galaxies away from us at great velocities. However, if \\nthe universe one day stops expanding and begins to contract, it will \\neventually collapse into a fiery cataclysm called the Big Crunch, in which \\nall intelligent life will be vaporized by fantastic heat. Nevertheless, some \\nphysicists have speculated that the hyperspace theory may provide the \\none and only hope of a refuge for intelligent life. In the last seconds of \\nthe death of our universe, intelligent life may escape the collapse by \\nfleeing into hyperspace. \\n\\n\\n\\nPreface \\n\\n\\nXI \\n\\n\\nIn Part IV, we conclude with a final, practical question: If the theory \\nis proved correct, then when will we be able to harness the power of the \\nhyperspace theory? This is not just an academic question, because in the \\npast, the harnessing ofjust one of the four fundamental forces irrevo- \\ncably changed the course ofhuman history, lifting us from the ignorance \\nand squalor of ancient, preindustrial societies to modern civilization. In \\nsome sense, even the vast sweep of human history can be viewed in a \\nnew light, in terms of the progressive mastery of each of the four forces. \\nThe history of civilization has undergone a profound change as each of \\nthese forces was discovered and mastered. \\n\\nFor example, when Isaac Newton wrote down the classical laws of \\ngravity, he developed the theory of mechanics, which gave us the laws \\ngoverning machines. This, in turn, greatly accelerated the Industrial Rev- \\nolution, which unleashed political forces that eventually overthrew the \\nfeudal dynasties ofEurope. In the mid-1860s, whenJames Clerk Maxwell \\nwrote down the fundamental laws of the electromagnetic force, he ush- \\nered in the Electric Age, which gave us the dynamo, radio, television, \\nradar, household appliances, the telephone, microwaves, consumer elec- \\ntronics, the electronic computer, lasers, and many other electronic mar- \\nvels. Without the understanding and utilization of the electromagnetic \\nforce, civilization would have stagnated, frozen in a time before the dis- \\ncovery of the light bulb and the electric motor. In the mid-1940s, when \\nthe nuclear force was harnessed, the world was again turned upside \\ndown with the development of the atomic and hydrogen bombs, the \\nmost destructive weapons on the planet. Because we are not on the verge \\nof a unified understanding of all the cosmic forces governing the uni- \\nverse, one might expect that any civilization that masters the hyperspace \\ntheory will become lord of the universe. \\n\\nSince the hyperspace theory is a well-defined body of mathematical \\nequations, we can calculate the precise energy necessary to twist space \\nand time into a pretzel or to create wormholes linking distant parts of \\nour universe. Unfortunately, the results are disappointing. The energy \\nrequired far exceeds anything that our planet can muster. In fact, the \\nenergy is a quadrillion times larger than the energy of our largest atom \\nsmashers. We must wait centuries or even millennia until our civilization \\ndevelops the technical capability of manipulating space-time, or hope \\nfor contact with an advanced civilization that has already mastered \\nhyperspace. The book therefore ends by exploring the intriguing but \\nspeculative scientific question of what level of technology is necessary \\nfor us to become masters of hyperspace. \\n\\nBecause the hyperspace theory takes us far beyond normal, common- \\n\\n\\n\\nxii Preface \\n\\nsense conceptions of space and time, I have scattered throughout the \\ntext a few purely hypothetical stories. I was inspired to utilize this ped- \\nagogical technique by the story of Nobel Prize winner Isidore I. Rabi \\naddressing an audience of physicists. He lamented the abysmal state of \\nscience education in the United States and scolded the physics com- \\nmunity for neglecting its duty in popularizing the adventure of science \\nfor the general public and especially for the young. In fact, he admon- \\nished, science-fiction writers had done more to communicate the \\nromance of science than all physicists combined. \\n\\nIn a previous book, Beyond Einstein: The Cosmic Quest for the Theory of \\nthe Universe (coauthored with Jennifer Trainer), I investigated super- \\nstring theory, described the nature of subatomic particles, and discussed \\nat length the visible universe and how all the complexities of matter might \\nbe explained by tiny, vibrating strings. In this book. I have expanded on \\na different theme and explored the invisible universe \\xe2\\x80\\x94 that is, the world \\nof geometry and space-time. The focus of this book is not the nature of \\nsubatomic particles, but the higher-dimensional world in which they \\nprobably live. In the process, readers will see that higher-dimensional \\nspace, instead of being an empty, passive backdrop against which quarks \\nplay out their eternal roles, actually becomes the central actor in the \\ndrama of nature. \\n\\nIn discussing the fascinating history of the hyperspace theory, we will \\nsee that the search for the ultimate nature of matter, begun by the \\nGreeks 2 millennia ago, has been a long and tortuous one. When the \\nfinal chapter in this long saga is written by future historians of science, \\nthey may well record that the crucial breakthrough was the defeat of \\ncommon-sense theories of three or four dimensions and the victory of \\nthe theory of hyperspace. \\n\\n\\nNew York \\nMay 1993 \\n\\n\\nM.K. \\n\\n\\n\\nAcknowledgments \\n\\n\\nIn writing this book, I have been fortunate to have Jeffrey Robbins as \\nmy editor.

I am not interested \\nin this or that phenomenon. I want to know His thoughts, the \\nrest are details. \\n\\nAlbert Einstein \\n\\n\\nThe Education of a Physicist \\n\\n\\nT WO incidents from my childhood greatly enriched my understand- \\ning of the world and sent me on course to become a theoretical \\nphysicist. \\n\\nI remember that my parents would sometimes take me to visit the \\nfamous Japanese Tea Garden in San Francisco. One of my happiest \\nchildhood memories is of crouching next to the pond, mesmerized by \\nthe brilliantly colored carp swimming slowly beneath the water lilies. \\n\\nIn these quiet moments, I felt free to let my imagination wander; I \\nwould ask myself silly questions that a only child might ask, such as how \\nthe carp in that pond would view the world around them. I thought. \\nWhat a strange world theirs must be! \\n\\nLiving their entire lives in the shallow pond, the carp would believe \\nthat their \"universe\" consisted of the murky water and the lilies. Spend- \\ning most of their time foraging on the bottom of the pond, they would \\nbe only dimly aware that an alien world could exist above the surface. \\n\\n\\n3 \\n\\n\\n\\n4 \\n\\n\\nENTERING THE FIFTH DIMENSION \\n\\n\\nThe nature of my world was beyond their comprehension. I was \\nintrigued that I could sit only a few inches from the carp, yet be separated \\nfrom them by an immense chasm. The carp and I spent our lives in two \\ndistinct universes, never entering each other\\'s world, yet were separated \\nby only the thinnest barrier, the water\\'s surface. \\n\\nI once imagined that there may be carp \"scientists\" living among \\nthe fish. They would, I thought, scoff at any fish who proposed that a \\nparallel world could existjust above the lilies. To a carp \"scientist,\" the \\nonly things that were real were what the fish could see or touch. The \\npond was everything. An unseen world beyond the pond made no sci- \\nentific sense. \\n\\nOnce I was caught in a rainstorm. I noticed that the pond\\'s surface \\nwas bombarded by thousands of tiny raindrops. The pond\\'s surface \\nbecame turbulent, and the water lilies were being pushed in all direc- \\ntions by water waves. Taking shelter from the wind and the rain, I won- \\ndered how all this appeared to the carp. To them, the water lilies would \\nappear to be moving around by themselves, without anything pushing \\nthem. Since the water they lived in would appear invisible, much like \\nthe air and space around us, they would be baffled that the water lilies \\ncould move around by themselves. \\n\\nTheir \"scientists,\" I imagined, would concoct a clever invention \\ncalled a \"force\" in order to hide their ignorance. Unable to compre- \\nhend that there could be waves on the unseen surface, they would con- \\nclude that lilies could move without being touched because a mysterious, \\ninvisible entity called a force acted between them. They might give this \\nillusion impressive, lofty names (such as action-at-a-distance, or the abil- \\nity of the lilies to move without anything touching them). \\n\\nOnce I imagined what would happen if I reached down and lifted \\none of the carp \"scientists\" out of the pond. Before I threw him back \\ninto the water, he might wiggle furiously as I examined him. I wondered \\nhow this would appear to the rest of the carp. To them, it would be a \\ntruly unsettling event. They would first notice that one of their \"scien- \\ntists\" had disappeared from their universe. Simply vanished, without \\nleaving a trace. Wherever they would look, there would be no evidence \\nof the missing carp in their universe. Then, seconds later, when I threw \\nhim back into the pond, the \"scientist\" would abruptly reappear out of \\nnowhere. To the other carp, it would appear that a miracle had hap \\npened. \\n\\nAfter collecting his wits, the \"scientist\" would tell a truly amazing \\nstory. \"Without warning,\" he would say, \"I was somehow lifted out of \\nthe universe (the pond) and hurled into a mysterious netherworld, with \\n\\n\\n\\nWorlds Beyond Space and Time \\n\\n\\n5 \\n\\n\\nblinding lights and strangely shaped objects that I had never seen before. \\nThe strangest of all was the creature who held me prisoner, who did not \\nresemble a fish in the slightest. I was shocked to see that it had no fins \\nwhatsoever, but nevertheless could move without them. It struck me that \\nthe familiar laws of nature no longer applied in this nether world. Then, \\njust as suddenly, I found myself thrown back into our universe.\" (This \\nstory, of course, of ajourney beyond the universe would be so fantastic \\nthat most of the carp would dismiss it as utter poppycock.) \\n\\nI often think that we are like the carp swimming contentedly in that \\npond. We live out our lives in our own \"pond.\" confident that our uni- \\nverse consists of only those things we can see or touch. Like the carp, \\nour universe consists of only the familiar and the visible. We smugly \\nrefuse to admit that parallel universes or dimensions can exist next to \\nours, just beyond our grasp. If our scientists invent concepts like forces, \\nit is only because they cannot visualize the invisible vibrations that fill \\nthe empty space around us. Some scientists sneer at the mention of \\nhigher dimensions because they cannot be conveniently measured in \\nthe laboratory. \\n\\nEver since that time, I have been fascinated by the possibility of other \\ndimensions. Like most children, I devoured adventure stories in which \\ntime travelers entered other dimensions and explored unseen parallel \\nuniverses, where the usual laws of physics could be conveniently sus- \\npended. I grew up wondering if ships that wandered into the Bermuda \\nTriangle mysteriously vanished into a hole in space; I marveled at Isaac \\nAsimov\\'s Foundation Series, in which the discovery of hyperspace travel \\nled to the rise of a Galactic Empire. \\n\\nA second incident from my childhood also made a deep, lasting \\nimpression on me. When I was 8 years old. I heard a story that would \\nstay with me for the rest of my life. I remember my schoolteachers telling \\nthe class about a great scientist who had just died. They talked about \\nhim with great reverence, calling him one of the greatest scientists in all \\nhistory. They said that very few people could understand his ideas, but \\nthat his discoveries changed the entire world and everything around us. \\nI didn\\'t understand much of what they were trying to tell us, but what \\nmost intrigued me about this man was that he died before he could \\ncomplete his greatest discovery. They said he spent years on this theory, \\nbut he died with his unfinished papers still sitting on his desk. \\n\\nI was fascinated by the story. To a child, this was a great mystery. \\nWhat was his unfinished work? What was in those papers on his desk? \\nWhat problem could possibly be so difficult and so important that such \\na great scientist would dedicate years of his life to its pursuit? Curious, I \\n\\n\\n\\n6 \\n\\n\\nENTERING THE FIFTH DIMENSION \\n\\n\\ndecided to learn all I could about Albert Einstein and his unfinished \\ntheory. I still have warm memories of spending many quiet hours reading \\nevery book I could find about this great man and his theories. When I \\nexhausted the books in our local library. I began to scour libraries and \\nbookstores across the city, eagerly searching for more clues. I soon \\nlearned that this story was far more exciting than any murder mystery \\nand more important than anything I could ever imagine. I decided that \\nI would try to get to the root of this mystery, even if I had to become a \\ntheoretical physicist to do it. \\n\\nI soon learned that the unfinished papers on Einstein\\'s desk were an \\nattempt to construct what he called the unified field theory, a theory \\nthat could explain all the laws of nature, from the tiniest atom to the \\nlargest galaxy. However, being a child, I didn\\'t understand that perhaps \\nthere was a link between the carp swimming in the Tea Garden and the \\nunfinished papers lying on Einstein\\'s desk. I didn\\'t understand that \\nhigher dimensions might be the key to solving the unified field theory. \\n\\nLater, in high school, I exhausted most of the local libraries and often \\nvisited the Stanford University physics library. There. I came across the \\nfact that Einstein\\'s work made possible a new substance called antimat- \\nter, which would act like ordinary matter but would annihilate upon \\ncontact with matter in a burst of energy. I also read that scientists had \\nbuilt large machines, or \"atom smashers,\" that could produce micro- \\nscopic quantities of this exotic substance in the laboratory. \\n\\nOne advantage ofyouth is that it is undaunted by worldly constraints \\nthat would ordinarily seem insurmountable to most adults. Not appre- \\nciating the obstacles involved, I set out to build my own atom smasher. \\nI studied the scientific literature until I was convinced that I could build \\nwhat was called a betatron, which could boost electrons to millions of \\nelectron volts. (A million electron volts is the energy attained by elec- \\ntrons accelerated by a field of a million volts.) \\n\\nFirst, I purchased a small quantity of sodium-22, which is radioactive \\nand naturally emits positrons (the antimatter counterpart of electrons). \\nThen I built what is called a cloud chamber, which makes visible the \\ntracks left by subatomic particles. I was able to take hundreds ofbeautiful \\nphotographs of the tracks left behind by antimatter. Next, I scavenged \\naround large electronic warehouses in the area, assembled the necessary \\nhardware, including hundreds of pounds of scrap transformer steel, and \\nbuilt a 2.3-million-electron-volt betatron in my garage that would be pow- \\nerful enough to produce a beam of antielectrons. To construct the mon- \\nstrous magnets necessary for the betatron, I convinced my parents to \\nhelp me wind 22 miles of cooper wire on the high-school football field. \\n\\n\\n\\nWorlds Beyond Space and Time \\n\\n\\n7 \\n\\n\\nWe spent Christmas vacation on the 50-yard line, winding and assem- \\nbling the massive coils that would bend the paths of the high-energy \\nelectrons. \\n\\nWhen finally constructed, the 300-pound, 6-kilowatt betatron con- \\nsumed every ounce of energy my house produced. When I turned it on, \\nI would usually blow every fuse, and the house would suddenly became \\ndark. With the house plunged periodically into darkness, my mother \\nwould often shake her head. (I imagined that she probably wondered \\nwhy she couldn\\'t have a child who played baseball or basketball, instead \\nofbuilding these huge electrical machines in the garage.) I was gratified \\nthat the machine successfully produced a magnetic field 20.000 times \\nmore powerful than the earth\\'s magnetic field, which is necessary to \\naccelerate a beam of electrons. \\n\\n\\nConfronting the Fifth Dimension \\n\\nBecause my family was poor, my parents were concerned that I wouldn\\'t \\nbe able to continue my experiments and my education. Fortunately, the \\nawards that I won for my various science projects caught the attention \\nof the atomic scientist Edward Teller. His wife generously arranged for \\nme to receive a 4-year scholarship to Harvard, allowing me to fulfill my \\ndream. \\n\\nIronically, although at Harvard I began my formal training in theo- \\nretical physics, it was also where my interest in higher dimensions grad- \\nually died out. Like other physicists, I began a rigorous and thorough \\nprogram of studying the higher mathematics of each of the forces of \\nnature separately, in complete isolation from one another. I still remem- \\nber solving a problem in electrodynamics for my instructor, and then \\nasking him what the solution might look like if space were curved in a \\nhigher dimension. He looked at me in a strange way, as if I were a bit \\ncracked. Like others before me, I soon learned to put aside my earlier, \\nchildish notions about higher-dimensional space. Hyperspace. I was told, \\nwas not a suitable subject of serious study. \\n\\nI was never satisfied with this disjointed approach to physics, and my \\nthoughts would often drift back to the the carp living in the Tea Garden. \\nAlthough the equations we used for electricity and magnetism, discov- \\nered by Maxwell in the nineteenth century, worked surprisingly well, the \\nequations seemed rather arbitrary. I felt that physicists (like the carp) \\ninvented these \"forces\" to hide our ignorance of how objects can move \\neach other without touching. \\n\\n\\n\\n8 \\n\\n\\nENTERING THE FIFTH DIMENSION \\n\\n\\nIn my studies, I learned that one of the great debates of the nine- \\nteenth century had been about how light travels through a vacuum. \\n(Light from the stars, in fact, can effortlessly travel trillions upon trillions \\nof miles through the vacuum of outer space.) Experiments also showed \\nbeyond question that light is a wave. But if light were a wave, then it \\nwould require something to be \"waving.\" Soundwaves require air, water \\nwaves require water, but since there is nothing to wave in a vacuum, we \\nhave a paradox. How can light be a wave if there is nothing to wave? So \\nphysicists conjured up a substance called the aether, which filled the \\nvacuum and acted as the medium for light. However, experiments con- \\nclusively showed that the \"aether\" does not exist.* \\n\\nFinally, when I became a graduate student in physics at the University \\nof California at Berkeley, I learned quite by accident that there was an \\nalternative, albeit controversial, explanation of how light can travel \\nthrough a vacuum. This alternative theory was so outlandish that I \\nreceived quite ajolt when I stumbled across it. That shock was similar \\nto the one experienced by many Americans when they first heard that \\nPresident John Kennedy had been shot. They can invariably remember \\nthe precise moment when they heard the shocking news, what they were \\ndoing, and to whom they were talking at that instant. We physicists, too, \\nreceive quite a shock when we first stumble across Kaluza-Klein theory \\nfor the first time. Since the theory was considered to be a wild specula- \\ntion, it was never taught in graduate school; so young physicists are left \\nto discover it quite by accident in their casual readings. \\n\\nThis alternative theory gave the simplest explanation of light: that it \\nwas really a vibration of the fifth dimension, or what used to called the \\nfourth dimension by the mystics. If light could travel through a vacuum, \\nit was because the vacuum itself was vibrating, because the \"vacuum\" \\nreally existed in four dimensions of space and one of time. By adding \\nthe fifth dimension, the force of gravity and light could be unified in a \\nstartlingly simple way. Looking back at my childhood experiences at the \\nTea Garden, I suddenly realized that this was the mathematical theory \\nfor which I had been looking. \\n\\nThe old Kaluza-Klein theory, however, had many difficult, technical \\nproblems that rendered it useless for over half a century. All this, how- \\never, has changed in the past decade. More advanced versions of the \\ntheory, like supergravity theory and especially superstring theory, have \\n\\n\\n*Surprisingly, even today physicists still do not have a real answer to this puzzle, but \\nover the decades we have simply gotten used to the idea that light can travel through a \\nvacuum even if there is nothing to wave. \\n\\n\\n\\nWorlds Beyond Space and Time \\n\\n\\n9 \\n\\n\\nfinally eliminated the inconsistencies of the theory. Rather abruptly, the \\ntheory of higher dimensions is now being championed in research lab- \\noratories around the globe. Many of the world\\'s leading physicists now \\nbelieve that dimensions beyond the usual four of space and time might \\nexist. This idea, in fact, has become the focal point of intense scientific \\ninvestigation. Indeed, many theoretical physicists now believe that \\nhigher dimensions may be the decisive step in creating a comprehensive \\ntheory that unites the laws of nature \\xe2\\x80\\x94 a theory of hyperspace. \\n\\nIf it proves to be correct, then future historians of science may well \\nrecord that one of the great conceptual revolutions in twentieth-century \\nscience was the realization that hyperspace may be the key to unlock the \\ndeepest secrets of nature and Creation itself. \\n\\nThis seminal concept has sparked an avalanche of scientific research: \\nSeveral thousand papers written by theoretical physicists in the major \\nresearch laboratories around the world have been devoted to exploring \\nthe properties of hyperspace. The pages of Nuclear Physics and Physics \\nLetters, two leading scientific journals, have been flooded with articles \\nanalyzing the theory. More than 200 international physics conferences \\nhave been sponsored to explore the consequences of higher dimensions. \\n\\nUnfortunately, we are still far from experimentally verifying that our \\nuniverse exists in higher dimensions. (Precisely what it would take to \\nprove the correctness of the theory and possibly harness the power of \\nhyperspace will be discussed later in this book.) However, this theory \\nhas now become firmly established as a legitimate branch of modern \\ntheoretical physics. The Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton, for \\nexample, where Einstein spent the last decades of his life (and where \\nthis book was written), is now one of the active centers of research on \\nhigher-dimensional space-time. \\n\\nSteven Weinberg, who won the Nobel Prize in physics in 1979, sum- \\nmarized this conceptual revolution when he commented recently that \\ntheoretical physics seems to be becoming more and more like science \\nfiction. \\n\\n\\nWhy Can\\'t We See Higher Dimensions? \\n\\nThese revolutionary ideas seem strange at first because we take for \\ngranted that our everyday world has three dimensions. As the late phys- \\nicist Heinz Pagels noted. \"One feature of our physical world is so obvious \\nthat most people are not even puzzled by it \\xe2\\x80\\x94 the fact that space is three- \\ndimensional.\" 1 Almost by instinct alone, we know that any object can be \\n\\n\\n\\n10 \\n\\n\\nENTERING THE FIFTH DIMENSION \\n\\n\\ndescribed by giving its height, width, and depth. By giving three num- \\nbers, we can locate any position in space. If we want to meet someone \\nfor lunch in New York, we say, \"Meet me on the twenty-fourth floor of \\nthe building at the corner of Forty-second Street and First Avenue.\" Two \\nnumbers provide us the street corner; and the third, the height off the \\nground. \\n\\nAirplane pilots, too, know exactly where they are with three num- \\nbers \\xe2\\x80\\x94 their altitude and two coordinates that locate their position on a \\ngrid or map. In fact, specifying these three numbers can pinpoint any \\nlocation in our world, from the tip of our nose to the ends of the visible \\nuniverse. Even babies understand this: Tests with infants have shown that \\nthey will crawl to the edge of a cliff, peer over the edge, and crawl back. \\nIn addition to understanding \"left\" and \"right\" and \"forward\" and \\n\"backward\" instinctively, babies instinctively understand \"up\" and \\n\"down.\" Thus the intuitive concept of three dimensions is firmly embed- \\nded in our brains from an early age. \\n\\nEinstein extended this concept to include time as the fourth dimen- \\nsion. For example, to meet that someone for lunch, we must specify that \\nwe should meet at, say, 12:30 P.M. in Manhattan; that is, to specify an \\nevent, we also need to describe its fourth dimension, the time at which \\nthe event takes place. \\n\\nScientists today are interested in going beyond Einstein\\'s conception \\nof the fourth dimension. Current scientific interest centers on the fifth \\ndimension (the spatial dimension beyond time and the three dimen- \\nsions of space) and beyond. (To avoid confusion, throughout this book \\nI have bowed to custom and called the fourth dimension the spatial \\ndimension beyond length, breadth, and width. Physicists actually refer \\nto this as the fifth dimension, but I will follow historical precedent. We \\nwill call time the fourth temporal dimension.) \\n\\nFlow do we see the fourth spatial dimension? \\n\\nThe problem is, we can\\'t. Higher-dimensional spaces are impossible \\nto visualize; so it is futile even to try. The prominent German physicist \\nHermann von Helmholtz compared the inability to \"see\" the fourth \\ndimension with the inability of a blind man to conceive of the concept \\nof color. No matter how eloquently we describe \"red\" to a blind person, \\nwords fail to impart the meaning of anything as rich in meaning as color. \\nEven experienced mathematicians and theoretical physicists who have \\nworked with higher-dimensional spaces for years admit that they cannot \\nvisualize them. Instead, they retreat into the world of mathematical equa- \\ntions. But while mathematicians, physicists, and computers have no \\nproblem solving equations in multidimensional space, humans find it \\nimpossible to visualize universes beyond their own. \\n\\n\\n\\nWorlds Beyond Space and Time \\n\\n\\nn \\n\\n\\nAt best, we can use a variety of mathematical tricks, devised by math- \\nematician and mystic Charles Hinton at the turn of the century, to visu- \\nalize shadows of higher-dimensional objects. Other mathematicians, like \\nThomas Banchoff, chairman of the mathematics department at Brown \\nUniversity, have written computer programs that allow us to manipulate \\nhigher-dimensional objects by projecting their shadows onto flat, two- \\ndimensional computer screens. Like the Greek philosopher Plato, who \\nsaid that we are like cave dwellers condemned to see only the dim, gray \\nshadows of the rich life outside our caves, Banchoff\\'s computers allow \\nonly a glimpse of the shadows of higher-dimensional objects. (Actually, \\nwe cannot visualize higher dimensions because of an accident of evolu- \\ntion. Our brains have evolved to handle myriad emergencies in three \\ndimensions. Instantly, without stopping to think, we can recognize and \\nreact to a leaping lion or a charging elephant. In fact, those humans \\nwho could better visualize how objects move, turn, and twist in three \\ndimensions had a distinct survival advantage over those who could not. \\nUnfortunately, there was no selection pressure placed on humans to \\nmaster motion in four spatial dimensions. Being able to see the fourth \\nspatial dimension certainly did not help someone fend off a charging \\nsaber-toothed tiger. Lions and tigers do not lunge at us through the \\nfourth dimension.) \\n\\n\\nThe Laws of Nature Are Simpler in Higher Dimensions \\n\\nOne physicist who delights in teasing audiences about the properties of \\nhigher-dimensional universes is Peter Freund, a professor of theoretical \\nphysics at the University of Chicago\\'s renowned Enrico Fermi Institute. \\nFreund was one of the early pioneers working on hyperspace theories \\nwhen it was considered too outlandish for mainstream physics. For years, \\nFreund and a small group of scientists dabbled in the science of higher \\ndimensions in isolation; now, however, it has finally become fashionable \\nand a legitimate branch of scientific research. To his delight, he is find- \\ning that his early interest is at last paying off. \\n\\nFreund does not fit the traditional image of a narrow, crusty, dishev- \\neled scientist. Instead, he is urbane, articulate, and cultured, and has a \\nsly, impish grin that captivates nonscientists with fascinating stories of \\nfast-breaking scientific discoveries. He is equally at ease scribbling on a \\nblackboard littered with dense equations or exchanging light banter at \\na cocktail party. Speaking with a thick, distinguished Romanian accent, \\nFreund has a rare knack for explaining the most arcane, convoluted \\nconcepts of physics in a lively, engaging style. \\n\\n\\n\\n12 \\n\\n\\nENTERING THE FIFTH DIMENSION \\n\\n\\nTraditionally, Freund reminds us, scientists have viewed higher \\ndimensions with skepticism because they could not be measured and did \\nnot have any particular use. However, the growing realization among \\nscientists today is that any three-dimensional theory is \"too small\" to \\ndescribe the forces that govern our universe. \\n\\nAs Freund emphasizes, one fundamental theme running through the \\npast decade of physics has been that the laws of nature become simpler and \\nelegant when expressed in higher dimensions, which is their natural home. \\nThe laws of light and gravity find a natural expression when expressed \\nin higher-dimensional space-time. The key step in unifying the laws of \\nnature is to increase the number ofdimensions ofspace-time until more \\nand more forces can be accommodated. In higher dimensions, we have \\nenough \"room\" to unify all known physical forces. \\n\\nFreund, in explaining why higher dimensions are exciting the imag- \\nination of the scientific world, uses the following analogy: \"Think, for a \\nmoment, of a cheetah, a sleek, beautiful animal, one of the fastest on \\nearth, which roams freely on the savannas of Africa. In its natural habitat, \\nit is a magnificent animal, almost a work of art, unsurpassed in speed or \\ngrace by any other animal. Now,\" he continues. \\n\\n\\nthink of a cheetah that has been captured and thrown into a miserable \\ncage in a zoo. It has lost its original grace and beauty, and is put on display \\nfor our amusement. We see only the broken spirit of the cheetah in the \\ncage, not its original power and elegance. The cheetah can be compared \\nto the laws of physics, which are beautiful in their natural setting. The \\nnatural habitat of the laws of physics is higher-dimensional space-time. \\nHowever, we can only measure the laws of physics when they have been \\nbroken and placed on display in a cage, which is our three-dimensional \\nlaboratory. We only see the cheetah when its grace and beauty have been \\nstripped away . 2 \\n\\n\\nFor decades, physicists have wondered why the four forces of nature \\nappear to be so fragmented \\xe2\\x80\\x94 why the \"cheetah\" looks so pitiful and \\nbroken in his cage. The fundamental reason why these four forces seem \\nso dissimilar, notes Freund, is that we have been observing the \"caged \\ncheetah.\" Our three-dimensional laboratories are sterile zoo cages for \\nthe laws of physics. But when we formulate the laws in higher-dimen- \\nsional space-time, their natural habitat, we see their true brilliance and \\npower; the laws become simple and powerful. The revolution now sweep- \\ning over physics is the realization that the natural home for the cheetah \\nmay be hyperspace. \\n\\n\\n\\nWorlds Beyond Space and Time \\n\\n\\n13 \\n\\n\\nTo illustrate how adding a higher dimension can make things sim- \\npler, imagine how major wars were fought by ancient Rome. The great \\nRoman wars, often involving many smaller battlefields, were invariably \\nfought with great confusion, with rumors and misinformation pouring \\nin on both sides from many different directions. With battles raging on \\nseveral fronts, Roman generals were often operating blind. Rome won \\nits battles more from brute strength than from the elegance of its strat- \\negies. That is why one of the first principles of warfare is to seize the \\nhigh ground \\xe2\\x80\\x94 that is, to go up into the third dimension, above the two- \\ndimensional battlefield. From the vantage point of a large hill with a \\npanoramic view of the battlefield, the chaos of war suddenly becomes \\nvastly reduced. In other words, viewed from the third dimension (that \\nis, from the top of the hill), the confusion of the smaller battlefields \\nbecomes integrated into a coherent single picture. \\n\\nAnother application of this principle \\xe2\\x80\\x94 that nature becomes simpler \\nwhen expressed in higher dimensions \\xe2\\x80\\x94 is the central idea behind Ein- \\nstein\\'s special theory of relativity. Einstein revealed time to be the fourth \\ndimension, and he showed that space and time could conveniently be \\nunified in a four-dimensional theory. This, in turn, inevitably led to the \\nunification of all physical quantities measured by space and time, such \\nas matter and energy. He then found the precise mathematical expres- \\nsion for this unity between matter and energy: E = me\\', perhaps the most \\ncelebrated of all scientific equations.* \\n\\nTo appreciate the enormous power of this unification, let us now \\ndescribe the four fundamental forces, emphasizing how different they \\nare, and how higher dimensions may give us a unifying formalism. Over \\nthe past 2.000 years, scientists have discovered that all phenomena in \\nour universe can be reduced to four forces, which at first bear no resem- \\nblance to one another. \\n\\nThe Electromagnetic Force \\n\\nThe electromagnetic force takes a variety of forms, including electricity, \\nmagnetism, and light itself. The electromagnetic force lights our cities, \\nfills the air with music from radios and stereos, entertains us with tele- \\nvision, reduces housework with electrical appliances, heats our food with \\n\\n\\n*The theory of higher dimensions is certainly not merely an academic one, because \\nthe simplest consequence of Einstein\\'s theory is the atomic bomb, which has changed the \\ndestiny of humanity. In this sense, the introduction of higher dimensions has been one of \\nthe pivotal scientific discoveries in all human history. \\n\\n\\n\\n14 \\n\\n\\nENTERING THE FIFTH DIMENSION \\n\\n\\nmicrowaves, tracks our planes and space probes with radar, and electri- \\nfies our power plants. More recently, the power of the electromagnetic \\nforce has been used in electronic computers (which have revolutionized \\nthe office, home, school, and military) and in lasers (which have intro- \\nduced new vistas in communications, surgery, compact disks, advanced \\nPentagon weaponry, and even the check-out stands in groceries). More \\nthan half the gross national product of the earth, representing the accu- \\nmulated wealth of our planet, depends in some way on the electromag- \\nnetic force. \\n\\nThe Strong Nuclear Force \\n\\nThe strong nuclear force provides the energy that fuels the stars; it makes \\nthe stars shine and creates the brilliant, life-giving rays of the sun. If the \\nstrong force suddenly vanished, the sun would darken, ending all life \\non earth. In fact, some scientists believe that the dinosaurs were driven \\nto extinction 65 million years ago when debris from a comet impact was \\nblown high into the atmosphere, darkening the earth and causing the \\ntemperature around the planet to plummet. Ironically, it is also the \\nstrong nuclear force that may one day take back the gift of life. \\nUnleashed in the hydrogen bomb, the strong nuclear force could one \\nday end all life on earth. \\n\\nThe Weak Nuclear Force \\n\\nThe weak nuclear force governs certain forms of radioactive decay. \\nBecause radioactive materials emit heat when they decay or break apart, \\nthe weak nuclear force contributes to heating the radioactive rock deep \\nwithin the earth\\'s interior. This heat, in turn, contributes to the heat \\nthat drives the volcanoes, the rare but powerful eruptions of molten rock \\nthat reach the earth\\'s surface. The weak and electromagnetic forces are \\nalso exploited to treat serious diseases: Radioactive iodine is used to kill \\ntumors of the thyroid gland and fight certain forms of cancer. The force \\nof radioactive decay can also be deadly: It wreaked havoc at Three Mile \\nIsland and Chernobyl; it also creates radioactive waste, the inevitable by- \\nproduct of nuclear weapons production and commercial nuclear power \\nplants, which may remain harmful for millions of years. \\n\\nThe Gravitational Force \\n\\nThe gravitational force keeps the earth and the planets in their orbits \\nand binds the galaxy. Without the gravitational force of the earth, we \\n\\n\\n\\nWorlds Beyond Space and Time \\n\\n\\n15 \\n\\n\\nwould be flung into space like rag dolls by the spin of the earth. The air \\nwe breathe would be quickly diffused into space, causing us to asphyxiate \\nand making life on earth impossible. Without the gravitational force of \\nthe sun, all the planets, including the earth, would be flung from the \\nsolar system into the cold reaches of deep space, where sunlight is too \\ndim to support life. In fact, without the gravitational force, the sun itself \\nwould explode. The sun is the result of a delicate balancing act between \\nthe force of gravity, which tends to crush the star, and the nuclear force, \\nwhich tends to blast the sun apart. Without gravity, the sun would det- \\nonate like trillions upon trillions of hydrogen bombs. \\n\\nThe central challenge of theoretical physics today is to unify these four \\nforces into a single force. Beginning with Einstein, the giants of twenti- \\neth-century physics have tried and failed to find such a unifying scheme. \\nHowever, the answer that eluded Einstein for the last 30 years of his life \\nmay lie in hyperspace. \\n\\n\\nThe Quest for Unification \\n\\nEinstein once said, \"Nature shows us only the tail of the lion. But I do \\nnot doubt that the lion belongs to it even though he cannot at once \\nreveal himself because ofhis enormous size.\" 1 IfEinstein is correct, then \\nperhaps these four forces are the \"tail of the lion,\" and the \"lion\" itself \\nis higher-dimensional space-time. This idea has fueled the hope that \\nthe physical laws of the universe, whose consequences fill entire library \\nwalls with books densely packed with tables and graphs, may one day be \\nexplained by a single equation. \\n\\nCentral to this revolutionary perspective on the universe is the real- \\nization that higher-dimensional geometry may be the ultimate source of \\nunity in the universe. Simply put, the matter in the universe and the \\nforces that hold it together, which appear in a bewildering, infinite vari- \\nety of complex forms, may be nothing but different vibrations of hyper- \\nspace. This concept, however, goes against the traditional thinking \\namong scientists, who have viewed space and time as a passive stage on \\nwhich the stars and the atoms play the leading role. To scientists, the \\nvisible universe of matter seemed infinitely richer and more diverse than \\nthe empty, unmoving arena of the invisible universe of space-time. \\nAlmost all the intense scientific effort and massive government funding \\nin particle physics has historically gone to cataloging the properties of \\nsubatomic particles, such as \"quarks\" and \"gluons,\" rather than fath- \\n\\n\\n\\n16 \\n\\n\\nENTERING THE FIFTH DIMENSION \\n\\n\\noming the nature of geometry. Now, scientists are realizing that the \"use- \\nless\" concepts of space and time may be the ultimate source of beauty \\nand simplicity in nature. \\n\\nThe first theory of higher dimensions was called Kaluza-Klein theory, \\nafter two scientists who proposed a new theory of gravity in which light \\ncould be explained as vibrations in the fifth dimension. When extended \\nto N-dimensional space (where N can stand for any whole number), the \\nclumsy-looking theories of subatomic particles dramatically take on a \\nstartling symmetry. The old Kaluza-Klein theory, however, could not \\ndetermine the correct value of N, and there were technical problems in \\ndescribing all the subatomic particles. A more advanced version of this \\ntheory, called supergravity theory, also had problems. The recent interest \\nin the theory was sparked in 1984 by physicists Michael Green and John \\nSchwarz, who proved the consistency of the most advanced version of \\nKaluza-Klein theory, called superstring theory, which postulates that all \\nmatter consists of tiny vibrating strings. Surprisingly, the superstring the- \\nory predicts a precise number of dimensions for space and time: ten.* \\n\\nThe advantage of ten-dimensional space is that we have \"enough \\nroom\" in which to accommodate all four fundamental forces. Further- \\nmore, we have a simple physical picture in which to explain the confus- \\ningjumble of subatomic particles produced by our powerful atom smash- \\ners. Over the past 30 years, hundreds of subatomic particles have been \\ncarefully cataloged and studied by physicists among the debris created \\nby smashing together protons and electrons with atoms. Like bug col- \\nlectors patiently giving names to a vast collection of insects, physicists \\nhave at times been overwhelmed by the diversity and complexity of these \\nsubatomic particles. Today, this bewildering collection of subatomic par- \\nticles can be explained as mere vibrations of the hyperspace theory. \\n\\n\\nTraveling Through Space and Time \\n\\nThe hyperspace theory has also reopened the question of whether hyper- \\nspace can be used to travel through space and time. To understand this \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Freund chuckles when asked when we will be able to see these higher dimensions. We \\ncannot see these higher dimensions because they have \"curled up\" into a tiny ball so small \\nthat they can no longer be detected. According to Kaluza-Klein theory, the size of these \\ncurled up dimensions is called the Planck length,\\' which is 100 billion billion times smaller \\nthan the proton, too small to be probed by even by our largest atom smasher. High-energy \\nphysicists had hoped that the $11 billion superconducting supercollider (SSC) (which was \\ncanceled by Congress in October 1993) might have been able to reveal some indirect \\nglimmers of hyperspace. \\n\\n\\n\\nWorlds Beyond Space and Time \\n\\n\\n17 \\n\\n\\nconcept, imagine a race of tiny flatworms living on the surface of a large \\napple. It\\'s obvious to these worms that their world, which they call Apple- \\nworld, is flat and two dimensional, like themselves. One worm, however, \\nnamed Columbus, is obsessed by the notion that Appleworld is somehow \\nfinite and curved in something he calls the third dimension. He even \\ninvents two new words, up and down, to describe motion in this invisible \\nthird dimension. His friends, however, call him a fool for believing that \\nAppleworld could be bent in some unseen dimension that no one can \\nsee or feel. One day, Columbus sets out on a long and arduous journey \\nand disappears over the horizon. Eventually he returns to his starting \\npoint, proving that the world is actually curved in the unseen third \\ndimension. His journey proves that Appleworld is curved in a higher \\nunseen dimension, the third dimension. Although weary from his trav- \\nels, Columbus discovers that there is yet another way to travel between \\ndistant points on the apple: By burrowing into the apple, he can carve \\na tunnel, creating a convenient shortcut to distant lands. These tunnels, \\nwhich considerably reduce the time and discomfort of a longjourney, \\nhe calls wormholes. They demonstrate that the shortest path between two \\npoints is not necessarily a straight line, as he\\'s been taught, but a worm- \\nhole. \\n\\nOne strange effect discovered by Columbus is that when he enters \\none of these tunnels and exits at the other end, he finds himself back \\nin the past. Apparently, these wormholes connect parts of the \\napple where time beats at different rates. Some of the worms even \\nclaim that these wormholes can be molded into a workable time \\nmachine. \\n\\nLater, Columbus makes an even more momentous discovery \\xe2\\x80\\x94 his \\nAppleworld is actually not the only one in the universe. It is but one \\napple in a large apple orchard. His apple, he finds out, coexists with \\nhundreds of others, some with worms like themselves, and some \\nwithout worms. Under certain rare circumstances, he conjectures, it \\nmay even be possible to journey between the different apples in the \\norchard. \\n\\nWe human beings are like the flatworms. Common sense tells us that \\nour world, like their apple, is flat and three dimensional. No matter \\nwhere we go with our rocket ships, the universe seems flat. However, the \\nfact that our universe, like Appleworld, is curved in an unseen dimension \\nbeyond our spatial comprehension has been experimentally verified by \\na number of rigorous experiments. These experiments, performed on \\nthe path of light beams, show that starlight is bent as it moves across the \\n\\n\\nuniverse. \\n\\n\\n\\n18 \\n\\n\\nENTERING THE FIFTH DIMENSION \\n\\n\\nMultiply Connected Universes \\n\\nWhen we wake up in the morning and open the window to let in some \\nfresh air, we expect to see the front yard. We do not expect to face the \\ntowering pyramids of Egypt. Similarly, when we open the front door, we \\nexpect to see the cars on the street, not the craters and dead volcanoes \\nof a bleak, lunar landscape. Without even thinking about it, we assume \\nthat we can safely open windows or doors without being scared out of \\nour wits. Our world, fortunately, is not a Steven Spielberg movie. We act \\non a deeply ingrained prejudice (which is invariably correct) that our \\nworld is simply connected, that our windows and doorways are not \\nentrances to wormholes connecting our home to a far-away universe. (In \\nordinary space, a lasso of rope can always be shrunk to a point. If this is \\npossible, then the space is called simply connected. However, if the lasso \\nis placed around the entrance of the wormhole, then it cannot be shrunk \\nto a point. The lasso, in fact, enters the wormhole. Such spaces, where \\nlassos are not contractible, are called multiply connected. Although the \\nbending of our universe in an unseen dimension has been experimen- \\ntally measured, the existence of wormholes and whether our universe is \\nmultiply connected or not is still a topic of scientific controversy.) \\n\\nMathematicians dating back to Georg Bernhard Riemann have stud- \\nied the properties of multiply connected spaces in which different \\nregions of space and time are spliced together. And physicists, who once \\nthought this was merely an intellectual exercise, are now seriously study- \\ning multiply connected worlds as a practical model of our universe. \\nThese models are the scientific analogue of Alice\\'s looking glass. When \\nLewis Carroll\\'s White Rabbit falls down the rabbit hole to enter Won- \\nderland, he actually falls down a wormhole. \\n\\nWormholes can be visualized with a sheet of paper and a pair of \\nscissors: Take a piece of paper, cut two holes in it, and then reconnect \\nthe two holes with a long tube (Figure 1.1). As long as you avoid walking \\ninto the wormhole, our world seems perfectly normal. The usual laws of \\ngeometry taught in school are obeyed. However, if you fall into the \\nwormhole, you are instantly transported to a different region of space \\nand time. Only by retracing your steps and falling back into the worm- \\nhole can you return to your familiar world. \\n\\nTime Travel and Baby Universes \\n\\nAlthough wormholes provide a fascinating area of research, perhaps the \\nmost intriguing concept to emerge from this discussion of hyperspace \\n\\n\\n\\nWorlds Beyond Space and Time \\n\\n\\n19 \\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 1.1. Parallel universes may be graphically represented by two parallel \\nplanes. Normally, they never interact with each other. However, at times worm- \\nholes or tubes may open up between them, perhaps making communication and \\ntravel possible between them. This is now the subject of intense interest among \\ntheoretical physicists. \\n\\n\\nis the question of time travel. In the film Back to the Future, Michael J. \\nFox journeys back in time and meets his parents as teenagers before they \\nwere married. Unfortunately, his mother falls in love with him and spurns \\nhis father, raising the ticklish question of how he will be born if his \\nparents never marry and have children. \\n\\nTraditionally, scientists have held a dim opinion of anyone who \\nraised the question of time travel. Causality (the notion that every effect \\nis preceded, not followed, by a cause) is firmly enshrined in the foun- \\n\\n\\n20 \\n\\n\\nENTERING THE FIFTH DIMENSION \\n\\n\\ndations ofmodern science. However, in the physics ofwormholes, \"acau- \\nsal\" effects show up repeatedly. In fact, we have to make strong assump- \\ntions in order to prevent time travel from taking place. The main \\nproblem is that wormholes may connect not only two distant points in \\nspace, but also the future with the past. \\n\\nIn 1988, physicist Kip Thorne of the California Institute of Technol- \\nogy and his collaborators made the astonishing (and risky) claim that \\ntime travel is indeed not only possible, but probable under certain con- \\nditions. They published their claim not in an obscure \"fringe\" journal, \\nbut in the prestigious Physical Review Letters. This marked the first time \\nthat reputable physicists, and not crackpots, were scientifically advancing \\na claim about changing the course of time itself. Their announcement \\nwas based on the simple observation that a wormhole connects two \\nregions that exist in different time periods. Thus the wormhole may \\nconnect the present to the past. Since travel through the wormhole is \\nnearly instantaneous, one could use the wormhole to go backward in \\ntime. Unlike the machine portrayed in H. G. Wells\\'s The Time Machine, \\nhowever, which could hurl the protagonist hundreds of thousands of \\nyears into England\\'s distant future with the simple twist of a dial, a worm- \\nhole may require vast amounts of energy for its creation, beyond what \\nwill be technically possible for centuries to come. \\n\\nAnother bizarre consequence of wormhole physics is the creation of \\n\"baby universes\" in the laboratory. We are, of course, unable to re-create \\nthe Big Bang and witness the birth of our universe. However, Alan Guth \\nof the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who has made many \\nimportant contributions in cosmology, shocked many physicists a few \\nyears ago when he claimed that the physics of wormholes may make it \\npossible to create a baby universe of our own in the laboratory. By con- \\ncentrating intense heat and energy in a chamber, a wormhole may even- \\ntually open up, serving as an umbilical cord connecting our universe to \\nanother, much smaller universe. If possible, it would give a scientist an \\nunprecedented view of a universe as it is created in the laboratory. \\n\\n\\nMystics and Hyperspace \\n\\nSome of these concepts are not new. For the past several centuries, mys- \\ntics and philosophers have speculated about the existence of other uni- \\nverses and tunnels between them. They have long been fascinated by \\nthe possible existence of other worlds, undetectable by sight or sound, \\nyet coexisting with our universe. They have been intrigued by the pos- \\n\\n\\n\\nWorlds Beyond Space and Time \\n\\n\\n21 \\n\\n\\nsibility that these unexplored, nether worlds may even be tantalizingly \\nclose, in fact surrounding us and permeating us everywhere we move, \\nyet just beyond our physical grasp and eluding our senses. Such idle talk, \\nhowever, was ultimately useless because there was no practical way in \\nwhich to mathematically express and eventually test these ideas. \\n\\nGateways between our universe and other dimensions are also a \\nfavorite literary device. Science-fiction writers find higher dimensions to \\nbe an indispensable tool, using them as a medium for interstellar travel. \\nBecause of the astronomical distances separating the stars in the heav- \\nens, science-fiction writers use higher dimensions as a clever shortcut \\nbetween the stars. Instead of taking the long, direct route to other gal- \\naxies, rockets merely zip along in hyperspace by warping the space \\naround them. For instance, in the film Star Wars, hyperspace is a refuge \\nwhere Luke Skywalker can safely evade the Imperial Starships of the \\nEmpire. In the television series \"Star Trek: Deep Space Nine,\" a worm- \\nhole opens up near a remote space station, making it possible to span \\nenormous distances across the galaxy within seconds. The space station \\nsuddenly becomes the center of intense intergalactic rivalry over who \\nshould control such a vital link to other parts of the galaxy. \\n\\nEver since Flight 19, a group of U.S. military torpedo bombers, van- \\nished in the Caribbean 30 years ago, mystery writers too have used higher \\ndimensions as a convenient solution to the puzzle of the Bermuda Tri- \\nangle, or Devil\\'s Triangle. Some have conjectured that airplanes and \\nships disappearing in the Bermuda Triangle actually entered some sort \\nof passageway to another world. \\n\\nThe existence of these elusive parallel worlds has also produced end- \\nless religious speculation over the centuries. Spiritualists have wondered \\nwhether the souls of departed loved ones drifted into another dimen- \\nsion. The seventeenth-century British philosopher Henry More argued \\nthat ghosts and spirits did indeed exist and claimed that they inhabited \\nthe fourth dimension. In Enchiridion Metaphysician (1671), he argued for \\nthe existence of a nether realm beyond our tangible senses that served \\nas a home for ghosts and spirits. \\n\\nNineteenth-century theologians, at a loss to locate heaven and hell, \\npondered whether they might be found in a higher dimension. Some \\nwrote about a universe consisting of three parallel planes: the earth, \\nheaven, and hell. God himself, according to the theologian Arthur Wil- \\nlink, found his home in a world far removed from these three planes; \\nhe lived in infinite-dimensional space. \\n\\nInterest in higher dimensions reached its peak between 1870 and \\n1920, when the \"fourth dimension\" (a spatial dimension, different from \\n\\n\\n\\n22 \\n\\n\\nENTERING THE FIFTH DIMENSION \\n\\n\\nwhat we know as the fourth dimension of time) seized the public imag- \\nination and gradually cross-fertilized every branch of the arts and sci- \\nences, becoming a metaphor for the strange and mysterious. The fourth \\ndimension appeared in the literary works of Oscar Wilde, Fyodor Dos- \\ntoyevsky, Marcel Proust, H. G. Wells, and Joseph Conrad; it inspired \\nsome of the musical works of Alexander Scriabin, Edgard Varese, and \\nGeorge Antheil. It fascinated such diverse personalities as psychologist \\nWilliam James, literary figure Gertrude Stein, and revolutionary socialist \\nVladimir Lenin. \\n\\nThe fourth dimension also inspired the works of Pablo Picasso and \\nMarcel Duchamp and heavily influenced the development of Cubism \\nand Expressionism, two of the most influential art movements in this \\ncentury. Art historian Linda Dalrymple Henderson writes, \"Like a Black \\nHole, \\'the fourth dimension\\' possessed mysterious qualities that could \\nnot be completely understood, even by the scientists themselves. Yet, the \\nimpact of \\'the fourth dimension\\' was far more comprehensive than that \\nof Black Holes or any other more recent scientific hypothesis except \\nRelativity Theory after 1919.\\'\" \\n\\nSimilarly, mathematicians have long been intrigued by alternative \\nforms of logic and bizarre geometries that defy every convention of com- \\nmon sense. For example, the mathematician Charles L. Dodgson, who \\ntaught at Oxford University, delighted generations of schoolchildren by \\nwriting books \\xe2\\x80\\x94 as Lewis Carroll \\xe2\\x80\\x94 that incorporate these strange math- \\nematical ideas. When Alice falls down a rabbit hole or steps through the \\nlooking glass, she enters Wonderland, a strange place where Cheshire \\ncats disappear (leaving only their smile), magic mushrooms turn chil- \\ndren into giants, and Mad Hatters celebrate \"unbirthdays.\" The looking \\nglass somehow connects Alice\\'s world with a strange land where every- \\none speaks in riddles and common sense isn\\'t so common. \\n\\nSome of the inspiration for Lewis Carroll\\'s ideas most likely came \\nfrom the great nineteenth-century German mathematician Georg Bern- \\nhard Riemann, who was the first to lay the mathematical foundation of \\ngeometries in higher-dimensional space. Riemann changed the course \\nof mathematics for the next century by demonstrating that these uni- \\nverses, as strange as they may appear to the layperson, are completely \\nself-consistent and obey their own inner logic. To illustrate some of these \\nideas, think of stacking many sheets of paper, one on top of another. \\nNow imagine that each sheet represents an entire world and that each \\nworld obeys its own physical laws, different from those of all the other \\nworlds. Our universe, then, would not be alone, but would be one of \\n\\n\\n\\nWorlds Beyond Space and Time \\n\\n\\n23 \\n\\n\\nmany possible parallel worlds. Intelligent beings might inhabit some of \\nthese planes, completely unaware of the existence of the others. On one \\nsheet of paper, we might have Alice\\'s bucolic English countryside. On \\nanother sheet might be a strange world populated by mythical creatures \\nin the world of Wonderland. \\n\\nNormally, life proceeds on each of these parallel planes independent \\nof the others. On rare occasions, however, the planes may intersect and, \\nfor a brief moment, tear the fabric of space itself, which opens up a \\nhole \\xe2\\x80\\x94 or gateway \\xe2\\x80\\x94 between these two universes. Like the wormhole \\nappearing in \"Star Trek: Deep Space Nine,\" these gateways make travel \\npossible between these worlds, like a cosmic bridge linking two different \\nuniverses or two points in the same universe (Figure 1.2). Not surpris- \\ningly, Carroll found children much more open to these possibilities than \\nadults, whose prejudices about space and logic become more rigid over \\ntime. In fact, Riemann\\'s theory of higher dimensions, as interpreted by \\nLewis Carroll, has become a permanent part of children\\'s literature and \\nfolklore, giving birth to other children\\'s classics over the decades, such \\nas Dorothy\\'s Land of Oz and Peter Pan\\'s Never Never Land. \\n\\nWithout any experimental confirmation or compelling physical moti- \\nvation, however, these theories of parallel worlds languished as a branch \\nof science. Over 2 millennia, scientists have occasionally picked up the \\nnotion of higher dimensions, only to discard it as an untestable and \\ntherefore silly idea. Although Riemann\\'s theory of higher geometries \\nwas mathematically intriguing, it was dismissed as clever but useless. Sci- \\nentists willing to risk their reputations on higher dimensions soon found \\nthemselves ridiculed by the scientific community. Higher-dimensional \\nspace became the last refuge for mystics, cranks, and charlatans. \\n\\nIn this book, we will study the work of these pioneering mystics, \\nmainly because they devised ingenious ways in which a nonspecialist \\ncould \"visualize\" what higher-dimensional objects might look like. \\nThese tricks will prove useful to understand how these higher-dimen- \\nsional theories may be grasped by the general public. \\n\\nBy studying the work of these early mystics, we also see more clearly \\nwhat was missing from their research. We see that their speculations \\nlacked two important concepts: a physical and a mathematical principle. \\nFrom the perspective of modern physics, we now realize that the missing \\nphysical principle is that hyperspace simplifies the laws of nature, provid- \\ning the possibility of unifying all the forces of nature by purely geometric \\narguments. The missing mathematical \\'principle is called field theory, which \\nis the universal mathematical language of theoretical physics. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 1.2. Wormholes may connect a universe with itself, perhaps providing a \\nmeans of interstellar travel. Since wormholes may connect two different time eras, \\nthey may also provide a means for time travel. Wormholes may also connect an \\ninfinite series of parallel universes. The hope is that the hyperspace theory will be \\nable to determine whether wormholes are physically possible or merely a mathe- \\nmatical curiosity. \\n\\n\\n24 \\n\\n\\n\\nWorlds Beyond Space and Time \\n\\n\\n25 \\n\\n\\nField Theory: The Language of Physics \\n\\nFields were first introduced by the great nineteenth-century British sci- \\nentist Michael Faraday. The son of a poor blacksmith, Faraday was a self- \\ntaught genius who conducted elaborate experiments on electricity and \\nmagnetism. Fie visualized \"lines of force\" that, like long vines spreading \\nfrom a plant, emanated from magnets and electric charges in all direc- \\ntions and filled up all of space. With his instruments, Faraday could \\nmeasure the strength of these lines of force from a magnetic or an elec- \\ntric charge at any point in his laboratory. Thus he could assign a series \\nof numbers (the strength and direction of the force) to that point (and \\nany point in space). He christened the totality of these numbers at any \\npoint in space, treated as a single entity, a field. (There is a famous story \\nconcerning Michael Faraday. Because his fame had spread far and wide, \\nhe was often visited by curious bystanders. When one asked what his \\nwork was good for, he answered, \"What is the use of a child? It grows to \\nbe a man.\" One day, William Gladstone, then Chancellor of the Exche- \\nquer, visited Faraday in his laboratory. Knowing nothing about science, \\nGladstone sarcastically asked Faraday what use the huge electrical con- \\ntraptions in his laboratory could possibly have for England. Faraday \\nreplied, \"Sir, I know not what these machines will be used for, but I am \\nsure that one day you will tax them.\" Today, a large portion of the total \\nwealth of England is invested in the fruit of Faraday\\'s labors.) \\n\\nSimply put, a field is a collection of numbers defined at every point \\nin space that completely describes a force at that point. For example, \\nthree numbers at each point in space can describe the intensity and \\ndirection of the magnetic lines of force. Another three numbers every- \\nwhere in space can describe the electric field. Faraday got this concept \\nwhen he thought of a \"field\" plowed by a farmer. A farmer\\'s field occu- \\npies a two-dimensional region of space. At each point in the farmer\\'s \\nfield, one can assign a series of numbers (which describe, for example, \\nhow many seeds there are at that point). Faraday\\'s field, however, occu- \\npies a three-dimensional region of space. At each point, there is a series \\nof six numbers that describes both the magnetic and electric lines of \\nforce. \\n\\nWhat makes Faraday\\'s field concept so powerful is that all forces of \\nnature can be expressed as a field. However, we need one more ingre- \\ndient before we can understand the nature of any force: We must be \\nable to write down the equations that these fields obey. The progress of \\nthe past hundred years in theoretical physics can be succinctly summa- \\nrized as the search for the field equations of the forces of nature. \\n\\n\\n\\n26 \\n\\n\\nENTERING THE FIFTH DIMENSION \\n\\n\\nFor example, in the 1860s, Scottish physicist James Clerk Maxwell \\nwrote down the field equations for electricity and magnetism. In 1915, \\nEinstein discovered the field equations for gravity. After innumerable \\nfalse starts, the field equations for the subatomic forces were finally writ- \\nten down in the 1970s, utilizing the earlier work of C. N. Yang and his \\nstudent R. L. Mills. These fields, which govern the interaction of all \\nsubatomic particles, are now called Yang-Mills fields. However, the puzzle \\nthat has stumped physicists within this century is why the subatomic field \\nequations look so vastly different from the field equations of Einstein \\xe2\\x80\\x94 \\nthat is, why the nuclear force seems so different from gravity. Some of \\nthe greatest minds in physics have tackled this problem, only to fail. \\n\\nPerhaps the reason for their failure is that they were trapped by com- \\nmon sense. Confined to three or four dimensions, the field equations \\nof the subatomic world and gravitation are difficult to unify. The advan- \\ntage of the hyperspace theory is that the Yang-Mills field, Maxwell\\'s field, \\nand Einstein\\'s field can all be placed comfortably within the hyperspace \\nfield. We see that these fields fit together precisely within the hyperspace \\nfield like pieces in ajigsaw puzzle. The other advantage of field theory \\nis that it allows us to calculate the precise energies at which we can expect \\nspace and time to form wormholes. Unlike the ancients, therefore, we \\nhave the mathematical tools to guide us in building the machines that \\nmay one day bend space and time to our whims. \\n\\n\\nThe Secret of Creation \\n\\nDoes this mean that big-game hunters can now start organizing safaris \\nto the Mesozoic era to bag large dinosaurs? No. Thorne, Guth, and \\nFreund will all tell you that the energy scale necessary to investigate these \\nanomalies in space is far beyond anything available on earth. Freund \\nreminds us that the energy necessary to probe the tenth dimension is a \\nquadrillion times larger than the energy that can be produced by our \\nlargest atom smasher. \\n\\nTwisting space-time into knots requires energy on a scale that will \\nnot be available within the next several centuries or even millennia \\xe2\\x80\\x94 if \\never. Even if all the nations of the world were to band together to build \\na machine that could probe hyperspace, they would ultimately fail. And, \\nas Guth points out, the temperatures necessary to create a baby universe \\nin the laboratory is 1,000 trillion trillion degrees, far in excess of any- \\nthing available to us. In fact, that temperature is much greater than \\nanything found in the interior of a star. So, although it is possible that \\n\\n\\n\\nWorlds Beyond Space and Time \\n\\n\\n21 \\n\\n\\nEinstein\\'s laws and the laws of quantum theory might allow for time \\ntravel, this is not within the capabilities of earthlings like us, who can \\nbarely escape the feeble gravitational field of our own planet. While we \\ncan marvel at the implications ofwormhole research, realizing its poten- \\ntial is strictly reserved for advanced extraterrestrial civilizations. \\n\\nThere was only one period of time when energy on this enormous \\nscale was readily available, and that was at the instant of Creation. In \\nfact, the hyperspace theory cannot be tested by our largest atom smash- \\ners because the theory is really a theory of Creation. Only at the instant \\nof the Big Bang do we see the full power of the hyperspace theory com- \\ning into play. This raises the exciting possibility that the hyperspace the- \\nory may unlock the secret of the origin of the universe. \\n\\nIntroducing higher dimensions may be essential for prying loose the \\nsecrets of Creation. According to this theory, before the Big Bang, our \\ncosmos was actually a perfect ten-dimensional universe, a world where \\ninterdimensional travel was possible. However, this ten-dimensional \\nworld was unstable, and eventually it \"cracked\" in two, creating two \\nseparate universes: a four- and a six-dimensional universe. The universe \\nin which we live was born in that cosmic cataclysm. Our four-dimensional \\nuniverse expanded explosively, while our twin six-dimensional universe \\ncontracted violently, until it shrank to almost infinitesimal size. This \\nwould explain the origin of the Big Bang. If correct, this theory dem- \\nonstrates that the rapid expansion of the universe was just a rather minor \\naftershock of a much greater cataclysmic event, the cracking of space \\nand time itself. The energy that drives the observed expansion of the \\nuniverse is then found in the collapse of ten-dimensional space and time. \\nAccording to the theory, the distant stars and galaxies are receding from \\nus at astronomical speeds because of the original collapse of ten-dimen- \\nsional space and time. \\n\\nThis theory predicts that our universe still has a dwarf twin, a com- \\npanion universe that has curled up into a small six-dimensional ball that \\nis too small to be observed. This six-dimensional universe, far from being \\na useless appendage to our world, may ultimately be our salvation. \\n\\n\\nEvading the Death of the Universe \\n\\nIt is often said that the only constants of human society are death and \\ntaxes. For the cosmologist, the only certainty is that the universe will one \\nday die. Some believe that the ultimate death of the universe will come \\nin the form of the Big Crunch. Gravitation will reverse the cosmic expan- \\n\\n\\n\\n28 \\n\\n\\nENTERING THE FIFTH DIMENSION \\n\\n\\nsion generated by the Big Bang and pull the stars and galaxies back, \\nonce again, into a primordial mass. As the stars contract, temperatures \\nwill rise dramatically until all matter and energy in the universe are con- \\ncentrated into a colossal fireball that will destroy the universe as we know \\nit. All life forms will be crushed beyond recognition. There will be no \\nescape. Scientists and philosophers, like Charles Darwin and Bertrand \\nRussell, have written mournfully about the futility of our pitiful exis- \\ntence, knowing that our civilization will inexorably die when our world \\nends. The laws of physics, apparently, have issued the final, irrevocable \\ndeath warrant for all intelligent life in the universe. \\n\\nAccording to the late Columbia University physicist Gerald Feinberg, \\nthere is one, and perhaps only one, hope of avoiding the final calamity. \\nHe speculated that intelligent life, eventually mastering the mysteries of \\nhigher-dimensional space over billions ofyears, will use the other dimen- \\nsions as an escape hatch from the Big Crunch. In the final moments of \\nthe collapse of our universe, our sister universe will open up once again, \\nand interdimensional travel will become possible. As all matter is \\ncrushed in the final moments before doomsday, intelligent life forms \\nmay be able to tunnel into higher-dimensional space or an alternative \\nuniverse, avoiding the seemingly inevitable death of our universe. Then, \\nfrom their sanctuary in higher-dimensional space, these intelligent life \\nforms may be able to witness the death of the collapsing universe in a \\nfiery cataclysm. As our home universe is crushed beyond recognition, \\ntemperatures will rise violently, creating yet another Big Bang. From \\ntheir vantage point in hyperspace, these intelligent life forms will have \\nfront-row seats to the rarest of all scientific phenomena, the creation of \\nanother universe and of their new home. \\n\\n\\nMasters of Hyperspace \\n\\nAlthough field theory shows that the energy necessary to create these \\nmarvelous distortions of space and time is far beyond anything that mod- \\nern civilization can muster, this raises two important questions: How long \\nwill it take for our civilization, which is growing exponentially in knowl- \\nedge and power, to reach the point of harnessing the hyperspace theory? \\nAnd what about other intelligent life forms in the universe, who may \\nalready have reached that point? \\n\\nWhat makes this discussion interesting is that serious scientists have \\ntried to quantify the progress of civilizations far into the future, when \\nspace travel will have become commonplace and neighboring star sys- \\n\\n\\n\\nWorlds Beyond Space and Time \\n\\n\\n29 \\n\\n\\nterns or even galaxies will have been colonized. Although the energy \\nscale necessary to manipulate hyperspace is astronomically large, these \\nscientists point out that scientific growth will probably continue to rise \\nexponentially over the next centuries, exceeding the capabilities of \\nhuman minds to grasp it. Since World War II, the sum total of scientific \\nknowledge has doubled every 10 to 20 or so years, so the progress of \\nscience and technology into the twenty-first century may surpass our \\nwildest expectations. Technologies that can only be dreamed of today \\nmay become commonplace in the next century. Perhaps then one can \\ndiscuss the question of when we might become masters of hyperspace. \\n\\nTime travel. Parallel universes. Dimensional windows. \\n\\nBy themselves, these concepts stand at the edge of our understanding \\nof the physical universe. However, because the hyperspace theory is a \\ngenuine field theory, we eventually expect it to produce numerical \\nanswers determining whether these intriguing concepts are possible. If \\nthe theory produces nonsensical answers that disagree with physical \\ndata, then it must be discarded, no matter how elegant its mathematics. \\nIn the final analysis, we are physicists, not philosophers. But if it proves \\nto be correct and explains the symmetries of modern physics, then it will \\nusher in a revolution perhaps equal to the Copernican or Newtonian \\nrevolutions. \\n\\nTo have an intuitive understanding of these concepts, however, it is \\nimportant to start at the beginning. Before we can feel comfortable with \\nten dimensions, we must learn how to manipulate four spatial dimen- \\nsions. Using historical examples, we will explore the ingenious attempts \\nmade by scientists over the decades to give a tangible, visual represen- \\ntation of higher-dimensional space. The first part of the book, therefore, \\nwill stress the history behind the discovery of higher-dimensional space, \\nbeginning with the mathematician who started it all, Georg Bernhard \\nRiemann. Anticipating the next century of scientific progress, Riemann \\nwas the first to state that nature finds its natural home in the geometry \\nof higher-dimensional space. \\n\\n\\n\\nMathematicians \\nand Mystics \\n\\n\\nMagic is any sufficiently advanced technology. \\n\\nArthur C. Clarke \\n\\n\\nO N June 10, 1854, a new geometry was born. \\n\\nThe theory of higher dimensions was introduced when Georg \\nBernhard Riemann gave his celebrated lecture before the faculty of the \\nUniversity of Gottingen in Germany. In one masterful stroke, like open- \\ning up a musty, darkened room to the brilliance of a warm summer\\'s \\nsun, Riemann\\'s lecture exposed the world to the dazzling properties of \\nhigher-dimensional space. \\n\\nHis profoundly important and exceptionally elegant essay, \"On the \\nHypotheses Which Lie at the Foundation of Geometry,\" toppled the \\npillars of classical Greek geometry, which had successfully weathered all \\nassaults by skeptics for 2 millennia. The old geometry of Euclid, in which \\nall geometric figures are two or three dimensional, came tumbling down \\nas a new Riemannian geometry emerged from its ruins. The Riemannian \\nrevolution would have vast implications for the future of the arts and \\nsciences. Within 3 decades of his talk, the \"mysterious fourth dimen- \\nsion\" would influence the evolution of art, philosophy, and literature \\nin Europe. Within 6 decades of Riemann\\'s lecture, Einstein would use \\nfour-dimensional Riemannian geometry to explain the creation of the \\nuniverse and its evolution. And 130 years after his lecture, physicists \\n\\n\\n30 \\n\\n\\n\\nMathematicians and Mystics \\n\\n\\n31 \\n\\n\\nwould use ten-dimensional geometry to attempt to unite all the laws of \\nthe physical universe. The core of Riemann\\'s work was the realization \\nthat physical laws simplify in higher-dimensional space, the very theme \\nof this book. \\n\\n\\nBrilliance Amid Poverty \\n\\nIronically, Riemann was the least likely person to usher in such a deep \\nand thorough-going revolution in mathematical and physical thought. \\nHe was excruciatingly, almost pathologically, shy and suffered repeated \\nnervous breakdowns. He also suffered from the twin ailments that have \\nruined the lives of so many of the world\\'s great scientists throughout \\nhistory: abject poverty and consumption (tuberculosis). His personality \\nand temperament showed nothing of the breath-taking boldness, sweep, \\nand supreme confidence typical of his work. \\n\\nRiemann was born in 1826 in Hanover, Germany, the son of a poor \\nLutheran pastor, the second of six children. His father, who fought in \\nthe Napoleonic Wars, struggled as a country pastor to feed and clothe \\nhis large family. As biographer E. T. Bell notes, \"the frail health and \\nearly deaths of most of the Riemann children were the result of under- \\nnourishment in their youth and were not due to poor stamina. The \\nmother also died before her children were grown.\" \\n\\nAt a very early age. Riemann exhibited his famous traits: fantastic \\ncalculational ability, coupled with timidity, and a life-long horror of any \\npublic speaking. Painfully shy, he was the butt of cruel jokes by other \\nboys, causing him to retreat further into the intensely private world of \\nmathematics. \\n\\nHe also was fiercely loyal to his family, straining his poor health and \\nconstitution to buy presents for his parents and especially for his beloved \\nsisters. To please his father, Riemann set out to become a student of \\ntheology. His goal was to get a paying position as a pastor as quickly as \\npossible to help with his family\\'s abysmal finances. (It is difficult to imag- \\nine a more improbable scenario than that of a tongue-tied, timid young \\nboy imagining that he could deliver fiery, passionate sermons railing \\nagainst sin and driving out the devil.) \\n\\nIn high school, he studied the Bible intensely, but his thoughts always \\ndrifted back to mathematics; he even tried to provide a mathematical \\nproof of the correctness of Genesis. He also learned so quickly that he \\nkept outstripping the knowledge of his instructors, who found it impos- \\nsible to keep up with the boy. Finally, the principal of his school gave \\n\\n\\n\\n32 \\n\\n\\nENTERING THE FIFTH DIMENSION \\n\\n\\nRiemann a ponderous book to keep him occupied. The book was \\nAdrien-Marie Legendre\\'s Theory of Numbers, a huge 859-page master- \\npiece, the world\\'s most advanced treatise on the difficult subject of num- \\nber theory. Riemann devoured the book in 6 days. \\n\\nWhen his principal asked, \"How far did you read?\" the young Rie- \\nmann replied, \"That is certainly a wonderful book. I have mastered it.\" \\nNot really believing the bravado of this youngster, the principal several \\nmonths later asked obscure questions from the book, which Riemann \\nanswered perfectly? \\n\\nBeset by the daily struggle to put food on the table, Riemann\\'s father \\nmight have sent the boy to do menial labor. Instead, he scraped together \\nenough funds to send his 19-year-old son to the renowned University of \\nGottingen, where he first met Carl Friedrich Gauss, the acclaimed \\n\"Prince of Mathematicians,\" one of the greatest mathematicians of all \\ntime. Even today, if you ask any mathematician to rank the three most \\nfamous mathematicians in history, the names of Archimedes, Isaac New- \\nton, and Carl Gauss will invariably appear. \\n\\nLife for Riemann, however, was an endless series of setbacks and \\nhardships, overcome only with the greatest difficulty and by straining his \\nfrail health. Each triumph was followed by tragedy and defeat. For exam- \\nple, just as his fortunes began to improve and he undertook his formal \\nstudies under Gauss, a full-scale revolution swept Germany. The working \\nclass, long suffering under inhuman living conditions, rose up against \\nthe government, with workers in scores of cities throughout Germany \\ntaking up arms. The demonstrations and uprisings in early 1848 inspired \\nthe writings of another German, Karl Marx, and deeply affected the \\ncourse of revolutionary movements throughout Europe for the next 50 \\nyears. \\n\\nWith all of Germany swept up in turmoil, Riemann\\'s studies were \\ninterrupted. He was inducted into the student corps, where he had the \\ndubious honor of spending 16 weary hours protecting someone even \\nmore terrified than he: the king, who was quivering with fear in his \\nroyal palace in Berlin, trying to hide from the wrath of the working \\nclass. \\n\\n\\nBeyond Euclidean Geometry \\n\\n\\nNot only in Germany, but in mathematics, too, fierce revolutionary winds \\nwere blowing. The problem that riveted Riemann\\'s interest was the \\nimpending collapse ofyet another bastion of authority, Euclidean geom- \\n\\n\\n\\nMathematicians and Mystics \\n\\n\\n33 \\n\\n\\netry, which holds that space is three dimensional. Furthermore, this \\nthree-dimensional space is \"flat\" (in flat space, the shortest distance \\nbetween two points is a straight line; this omits the possibility that space \\ncan be curved, as on a sphere). \\n\\nIn fact, after the Bible, Euclid\\'s Elements was probably the most influ- \\nential book of all time. For 2 millennia, the keenest minds of Western \\ncivilization have marveled at its elegance and the beauty of its geometry. \\nThousands of the finest cathedrals in Europe were erected according to \\nits principles. In retrospect, perhaps it was too successful. Over the cen- \\nturies, it became something of a religion; anyone who dared to propose \\ncurved space or higher dimensions was relegated to the ranks of crack- \\npots or heretics. For untold generations, schoolchildren have wrestled \\nwith the theorems of Euclid\\'s geometry: that the circumference of a \\ncircle is pi times the diameter, and that the angles within a triangle add \\nup to 180 degrees. However, try as they might, the finest mathematical \\nminds for several centuries could not prove these deceptively simple \\npropositions. In fact, the mathematicians ofEurope began to realize that \\neven Euclid\\'s Elements, which had been revered for 2,300 years, was \\nincomplete. Euclid\\'s geometry was still viable if one stayed within the \\nconfines of flat surfaces, but if one strayed into the world of curved \\nsurfaces, it was actually incorrect. \\n\\nTo Riemann, Euclid\\'s geometry was particularly sterile when com- \\npared with the rich diversity of the world. Nowhere in the natural world \\ndo we see the flat, idealized geometric figures of Euclid. Mountain \\nranges, ocean waves, clouds, and whirlpools are not perfect circles, tri- \\nangles, and squares, but are curved objects that bend and twist in infinite \\ndiversity. \\n\\nThe time was ripe for a revolution, but who would lead it and what \\nwould replace the old geometry? \\n\\n\\nThe Rise of Riemannian Geometry \\n\\nRiemann rebelled against the apparent mathematical precision of Greek \\ngeometry, whose foundation, he discovered, ultimately was based on the \\nshifting sand of common sense and intuition, not the firm ground of \\nlogic. \\n\\nIt is obvious, said Euclid, that a point has no dimension at all. A line \\nhas one dimension: length. A plane has two dimensions: length and \\nbreadth. A solid has three dimensions: length, breadth, and height. And \\nthere it stops. Nothing has four dimensions. These sentiments were ech- \\n\\n\\n\\n34 \\n\\n\\nENTERING THE FIFTH DIMENSION \\n\\n\\noed by the philosopher Aristotle, who apparently was the first person to \\nstate categorically that the fourth spatial dimension is impossible. In On \\nHeaven, he wrote, \"The line has magnitude in one way, the plane in two \\nways, and the solid in three ways, and beyond these there is no other \\nmagnitude because the three are all.\" Furthermore, in A.D. 150, the \\nastronomer Ptolemy from Alexandria went beyond Aristotle and offered, \\nin his book On Distance, the first ingenious \"proof that the fourth \\ndimension is impossible. \\n\\nFirst, he said, draw three mutually perpendicular lines. For example, \\nthe corner of a cube consists of three mutually perpendicular lines. \\nThen, he argued, try to draw a fourth line that is perpendicular to the \\nother three lines. No matter how one tries, he reasoned, four mutually \\nperpendicular lines are impossible to draw. Ptolemy claimed that a \\nfourth perpendicular line is \"entirely without measure and without def- \\ninition.\" Thus the fourth dimension is impossible. \\n\\nWhat Ptolemy actually proved was that it is impossible to visualize the \\nfourth dimension with our three-dimensional brains. (In fact, today we \\nknow that many objects in mathematics cannot be visualized but can be \\nshown to exist.) Ptolemy may go down in history as the man who opposed \\ntwo great ideas in science: the sun-centered solar system and the fourth \\ndimension. \\n\\nOver the centuries, in fact, some mathematicians went out of their \\nway to denounce the fourth dimension. In 1685, the mathematician \\nJohn Wallis polemicized against the concept, calling it a \"Monster in \\nNature, less possible than a Chimera or Centaure. . . . Length, Breadth, \\nand Thickness, take up the whole of Space. Nor can Fansie imagine how \\nthere should be a Fourth Local Dimension beyond these Three.\" 1 For \\nseveral thousand years, mathematicians would repeat this simple but \\nfatal mistake, that the fourth dimension cannot exist because we cannot \\npicture it in our minds. \\n\\n\\nThe Unity of Ail Physical Law \\n\\nThe decisive break with Euclidean geometry came when Gauss asked his \\nstudent Riemann to prepare an oral presentation on the \"foundation \\nof geometry.\" Gauss was keenly interested in seeing if his student could \\ndevelop an alternative to Euclidean geometry. (Decades before. Gauss \\nhad privately expressed deep and extensive reservations about Euclidean \\ngeometry. He even spoke to his colleagues of hypothetical \"bookworms\" \\nthat might live entirely on a two-dimensional surface. He spoke of gen- \\n\\n\\n\\nMathematicians and Mystics \\n\\n\\n35 \\n\\n\\neralizing this to the geometry of higher-dimensional space. However, \\nbeing a deeply conservative man, he never published any of his work on \\nhigher dimensions because of the outrage it would create among the \\nnarrow-minded, conservative old guard. He derisively called them \\n\"Boeotians\" after a mentally retarded Greek tribe.*) \\n\\nRiemann, however, was terrified. This timid man, terrified of public \\nspeaking, was being asked by his mentor to prepare a lecture before the \\nentire faculty on the most difficult mathematical problem of the century. \\n\\nOver the next several months, Riemann began painfully developing \\nthe theory of higher dimensions, straining his health to the point of a \\nnervous breakdown. His stamina further deteriorated because of his dis- \\nmal financial situation. He was forced to take low-paying tutoringjobs \\nto provide for his family. Furthermore, he was becoming sidetracked \\ntrying to explain problems of physics. In particular, he was helping \\nanother professor, Wilhelm Weber, conduct experiments in a fascinat- \\ning new field of research, electricity. \\n\\nElectricity, of course, had been known to the ancients in the form of \\nlightning and sparks. But in the early nineteenth century, this phenom- \\nenon became the central focus of physics research. In particular, the \\ndiscovery that passing a current of wire across a compass needle can \\nmake the needle spin riveted the attention of the physics community. \\nConversely, moving a bar magnet across a wire can induce an electric \\ncurrent in the wire. (This is called Faraday\\'s Law, and today all electric \\ngenerators and transformers \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and hence much of the foundation of \\nmodern technology \\xe2\\x80\\x94 are based on this principle.) \\n\\nTo Riemann, this phenomenon indicated that electricity and mag- \\nnetism are somehow manifestations of the same force. Riemann was \\nexcited by the new discoveries and was convinced that he could give a \\nmathematical explanation that would unify electricity and magnetism. \\nHe immersed himself in Weber\\'s laboratory, convinced that the new \\nmathematics would yield a comprehensive understanding of these \\nforces. \\n\\nNow, burdened with having to prepare a major public lecture on the \\n\"foundation of geometry,\" to support his family, and to conduct sci- \\nentific experiments, his health finally collapsed and he suffered a ner- \\nvous breakdown in 1854. Later, he wrote to his father, \"I became so \\nabsorbed in my investigation of the unity of all physical laws that when \\nthe subject of the trial lecture was given me, I could not tear myself away \\nfrom my research. Then, partly as a result ofbrooding on it, partly from \\nstaying indoors too much in this vile weather, I fell ill.\" 5 This letter is \\nsignificant, for it clearly shows that, even during months of illness. \\n\\n\\n\\n36 \\n\\n\\nENTERING THE FIFTH DIMENSION \\n\\n\\nRiemann firmly believed that he would discover the \"unity of all physical \\nlaws\" and that mathematics would eventually pave the way for this uni- \\nfication. \\n\\n\\nForce = Geometry \\n\\nEventually, despite his frequent illnesses, Riemann developed a startling \\nnew picture of the meaning of a \"force.\" Ever since Newton, scientists \\nhad considered a force to be an instantaneous interaction between two \\ndistant bodies. Physicists called it action-at-a-distance, which meant that \\na body could influence the motions of distant bodies instantaneously. \\nNewtonian mechanics undoubtedly could describe the motions of the \\nplanets. However, over the centuries, critics argued that action-at-a-dis- \\ntance was unnatural, because it meant that one body could change the \\ndirection of another without even touching it. \\n\\nRiemann developed a radically new physical picture. Like Gauss\\'s \\n\"bookworms.\" Riemann imagined a race of two-dimensional creatures \\nliving on a sheet of paper. But the decisive break he made was to put \\nthese bookworms on a crumpled sheet of paper. 1 What would these book- \\nworms think about their world? Riemann realized that they would con- \\nclude that their world was still perfectly flat. Because their bodies would \\nalso be crumpled, these bookworms would never notice that their world \\nwas distorted. However, Riemann argued that if these bookworms tried \\nto move across the crumpled sheet of paper, they would feel a mysteri- \\nous, unseen \"force\" that prevented them from moving in a straight line. \\nThey would be pushed left and right every time their bodies moved over \\na wrinkle on the sheet. \\n\\nThus Riemann made the first momentous break with Newton in 200 \\nyears, banishing the action-at-a-distance principle. To Riemann, \"force\" \\nwas a consequence of geometry. \\n\\nRiemann then replaced the two-dimensional sheet with our three- \\ndimensional world crumpled in the fourth dimension. It would not be \\nobvious to us that our universe was warped. However, we would imme- \\ndiately realize that something was amiss when we tried to walk in a \\nstraight line. We would walk like a drunkard, as though an unseen force \\nwere tugging at us, pushing us left and right. \\n\\nRiemann concluded that electricity, magnetism, and gravity are \\ncaused by the crumpling of our three-dimensional universe in the \\nunseen fourth dimension. Thus a \"force\" has no independent life of its \\nown; it is only the apparent effect caused by the distortion of geometry. \\n\\n\\n\\nMathematicians and Mystics \\n\\n\\n37 \\n\\n\\nBy introducing the fourth spatial dimension, Riemann accidentally stum- \\nbled on what would become one of the dominant themes in modern \\ntheoretical physics, that the laws of nature appear simple when expressed \\nin higher-dimensional space. He then set about developing a mathe- \\nmatical language in which this idea could be expressed. \\n\\n\\nRiemann\\'s Metric Tensor: A New Pythagorean Theorem \\n\\nRiemann spent several months recovering from his nervous breakdown. \\nFinally, when he delivered his oral presentation in 1854, the reception \\nwas enthusiastic. In retrospect, this was, without question, one of the \\nmost important public lectures in the history of mathematics. Word \\nspread quickly throughout Europe that Riemann had decisively broken \\nout of the confines of Euclidean geometry that had ruled mathematics \\nfor 2 millennia. News of the lecture soon spread throughout all the \\ncenters of learning in Europe, and his contributions to mathematics \\nwere being hailed throughout the academic world. His talk was trans- \\nlated into several languages and created quite a sensation in mathemat- \\nics. There was no turning back to the work of Euclid. \\n\\nLike many of the greatest works in physics and mathematics, the \\nessential kernel underlying Riemann\\'s great paper is simple to under- \\nstand. Riemann began with the famous Pythagorean Theorem, one of \\nthe Greeks\\' greatest discoveries in mathematics. The theorem establishes \\nthe relationship between the lengths of the three sides of a right triangle: \\nIt states that the sum of the squares of the smaller sides equals the square \\nof the longest side, the hypotenuse; that is, if a and b are the lengths of \\nthe two short sides, and c is the length of the hypotenuse, then a 1 + b 1 \\n= c 2 . (The Pythagorean Theorem, of course, is the foundation of all \\narchitecture; every structure built on this planet is based on it.) \\n\\nFor three-dimensional space, the theorum can easily be generalized. \\nIt states that the sum of the squares of three adjacent sides of a cube is \\nequal to the square of the diagonal; so if a, b, and c represent the sides \\nof a cube, and d is its diagonal length, then a 2 + b 2 + c 2 = d (Figure \\n2.1). \\n\\nIt is now simple to generalize this to the case of N-dimensions . Imag- \\nine an N-dimensional cube. If a,b,c, . . . are the lengths of the sides of a \\n\"hypercube,\" and z is the length of the diagonal, then a 2 + b 2 + c 2 + \\nd 2 + . . . = z\\\\ Remarkably, even though our brains cannot visualize an \\nN-dimensional cube, it is easy to write down the formula for its sides. \\n(This is a common feature of working in hyperspace. Mathematically \\n\\n\\n\\n38 \\n\\n\\nENTERING THE FIFTH DIMENSION \\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 2.1. The length of a diagonal of a cube is given by a three-dimensional \\nversion of the Pythagorean Theorem: a = + h + c\\xe2\\x80\\x99 = d\\\\ By simply adding more \\nterms to the Pythagorean Theorem, this equation easily generalizes to the diagonal \\nof a hypercube in N dimensions. Thus although higher dimensions cannot be \\nvisualized, it is easy to represent N dimensions mathematically. \\n\\n\\nmanipulating N-dimensional space is no more difficult than manipulat- \\ning three-dimensional space. It is nothing short of amazing that on a \\nplain sheet of paper, you can mathematically describe the properties of \\nhigher-dimensional objects that cannot be visualized by our brains.) \\n\\nRiemann then generalized these equations for spaces of arbitrary \\ndimension. These spaces can be either flat or curved. If flat, then the \\nusual axioms of Euclid apply: The shortest distance between two points \\nis a straight line, parallel lines never meet, and the sum of the interior \\nangles of a triangle add to 180 degrees. But Riemann also found that \\nsurfaces can have \"positive curvature,\" as in the surface of a sphere, \\nwhere parallel lines always meet and where the sum of the angles of a \\ntriangle can exceed 180 degrees. Surfaces can also have \"negative cur- \\n\\n\\n\\nMathematicians and Mystics \\n\\n\\n3 9 \\n\\nvature,\" as in a saddle-shaped or a trumpet-shaped surface. On these \\nsurfaces, the sum of the interior angles of a triangle add to less than 180 \\ndegrees. Given a line and a point off that line, there are an infinite \\nnumber of parallel lines one can draw through that point (Figure 2.2). \\n\\nRiemann\\'s aim was to introduce a new object in mathematics that \\nwould enable him to describe all surfaces, no matter how complicated. \\nThis inevitably led him to reintroduce Faraday\\'s concept of the field. \\n\\nFaraday\\'s field, we recall, was like a farmer\\'s field, which occupies a \\nregion of two-dimensional space. Faraday\\'s field occupies a region of \\nthree-dimensional space; at any point in space, we assign a collection of \\nnumbers that describes the magnetic or electric force at that point. Rie- \\nmann\\'s idea was to introduce a collection of numbers at every point in \\nspace that would describe how much it was bent or curved. \\n\\nFor example, for an ordinary two-dimensional surface, Riemann \\nintroduced a collection of three numbers at every point that completely \\ndescribe the bending of that surface. Riemann found that in four spatial \\ndimensions, one needs a collection of ten numbers at each point to \\ndescribe its properties. No matter how crumpled or distorted the space, \\nthis collection of ten numbers at each point is sufficient to encode all \\nthe information about that space. Let us label these ten numbers by the \\nsymbols g\\xe2\\x80\\x9e g\\xe2\\x80\\x9e . . , . (When analyzing a four-dimensional space, the \\nlower index can range from one to four.) Then Riemann\\'s collection of \\nten numbers can be symmetrically arranged as in Figure 2.3.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 (It appears \\nas though there are 16 components. However, g ,, = g 2l , g\\xe2\\x80\\x9e = g,, and \\nso on, so there are actually only ten independent components.) Today, \\nthis collection of numbers is called the Riemann metric tensor. Roughly \\nspeaking, the greater the value of the metric tensor, the greater the \\ncrumpling of the sheet. No matter how crumpled the sheet of paper, \\nthe metric tensor gives us a simple means of measuring its curvature at \\nany point. Ifwe flattened the crumpled sheet completely, then we would \\nretrieve the formula of Pythagoras. \\n\\nRiemann\\'s metric tensor allowed him to erect a powerful apparatus \\nfor describing spaces of any dimension with arbitrary curvature. To his \\nsurprise, he found that all these spaces are well defined and self-consis- \\ntent. Previously, it was thought that terrible contradictions would arise \\nwhen investigating the forbidden world of higher dimensions. To his \\nsurprise, Riemann found none. In fact, it was almost trivial to extend his \\nwork to N-dimensional space. The metric tensor would now resemble \\nthe squares of a checker board that was IV X N in size. This will have \\nprofound physical implications when we discuss the unification of all \\nforces in the next several chapters. \\n\\n\\n\\nZero \\n\\ncurvature \\n\\n\\nPositive \\n\\ncurvature \\n\\n\\n\\nNegative \\n\\ncurvature \\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 2.2. A plane has zero curvature. In Euclidean geometry, the interior angles \\nof a triangle sum to 180 degrees, and parallel lines never meet. In non-Euclidean \\ngeometry, a sphere has positive curvature. A triangle\\'s interior angles sum to \\ngreater than 180 degrees and parallel lines always meet. (Parallel lines include \\narcs whose centers coincide with the center of the sphere. This rules out latitudinal \\nlines.) A saddle has negative curvature. The interior angles sum to less than 180 \\ndegrees. There are an infinite number of lines parallel to a given line that go \\nthrough a fixed point. \\n\\n\\n4 0 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 2.3. Riemann\\'s metric tensor contains all the information necessary to \\ndescribe mathematically a curved space in N dimensions. It takes 16 numbers to \\ndescribe the metric tensor for each point in four-dimensional space. These numbers \\ncan be arranged in a square array ( six of these numbers are actually redundant; \\nso the metric tensor has ten independent numbers). \\n\\n\\n(The secret of unification, we will see, lies in expanding Riemann\\'s \\nmetric to N-dimensional space and then chopping it up into rectangular \\npieces. Each rectangular piece corresponds to a different force. In this \\nway, we can describe the various forces of nature by slotting them into \\nthe metric tensor like pieces of a puzzle. This is the mathematical expres- \\nsion of the principle that higher-dimensional space unifies the laws of \\nnature, that there is \"enough room\" to unite them in N-dimensional \\nspace. More precisely, there is \"enough room\" in Riemann\\'s metric to \\nunite the forces of nature.) \\n\\nRiemann anticipated another development in physics; he was one of \\nthe first to discuss multiply connected spaces, or wormholes. To visualize \\nthis concept, take two sheets of paper and place one on top of the other. \\nMake a short cut on each sheet with scissors. Then glue the two sheets \\ntogether along the two cuts (Figure 2.4). (This is topologically the same \\nas Figure 1.1, except that the neck of the wormhole has length zero.) \\n\\nIf a bug lives on the top sheet, he may one day accidentally walk into \\nthe cut and find himself on the bottom sheet. He will be puzzled because \\neverything is in the wrong place. After much experimentation, the bug \\n\\n\\n\\n42 \\n\\n\\nENTERING THE FIFTH DIMENSION \\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 2.4.

Riemann\\'s cuts were used with great \\neffect by the mathematician Lewis Carroll in his book Through the Look- \\ning-Glass. Riemann\\'s cut, connecting England with Wonderland, is the \\nlooking glass. Today, Riemann\\'s cuts survive in two forms. First, they are \\ncited in every graduate mathematics course in the world when applied \\nto the theory of electrostatics or conformal mapping. Second, Riemann\\'s \\ncuts can be found in episodes of \"The Twilight Zone.\" (It should be \\nstressed that Riemann himself did not view his cuts as a mode of travel \\nbetween universes.) \\n\\n\\nRiemann\\'s Legacy \\n\\nRiemann persisted with his work in physics. In 1858, he even announced \\nthat he had finally succeeded in a unified description of light and elec- \\ntricity. He wrote, \"I am fully convinced that my theory is the correct one, \\nand that in a few years it will be recognized as such.\\'\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Although his \\nmetric tensor gave him a powerful way to describe any curved space in \\nany dimension, he did not know the precise equations that the metric \\ntensor obeyed; that is, he did not know what made the sheet crumple. \\n\\n\\n\\nMathematicians and Mystics \\n\\n\\n43 \\n\\n\\nUnfortunately, Riemann\\'s efforts to solve this problem were contin- \\nually thwarted by grinding poverty. His successes did not translate into \\nmoney. He suffered another nervous breakdown in 1857. After many \\nyears, he was finally appointed to Gauss\\'s coveted position at Gottingen, \\nbut it was too late. A life of poverty had broken his health, and like many \\nof the greatest mathematicians throughout history, he died prematurely \\nof consumption at the age of 39, before he could complete his geometric \\ntheory of gravity and electricity and magnetism. \\n\\nIn summary, Riemann did much more than lay the foundation of \\nthe mathematics of hyperspace. In retrospect, we see that Riemann antic- \\nipated some of the major themes in modern physics. Specifically, \\n\\n1. He used higher-dimensional space to simplify the laws of nature; \\nthat is, to him, electricity and magnetism as well as gravity were \\n\\njust effects caused by the crumpling or warping of hyperspace. \\n\\n2. He anticipated the concept of wormholes. Riemann\\'s cuts are \\nthe simplest examples of multiply connected spaces. \\n\\n3. He expressed gravity as a field. The metric tensor, because it \\ndescribes the force of gravity (via curvature) at every point in \\nspace, is precisely Faraday\\'s field concept when applied to \\ngravity. \\n\\nRiemann was unable to complete his work on force fields because he \\nlacked the field equations that electricity and magnetism and gravity \\nobey. In other words, he did not know precisely how the universe would \\nbe crumpled in order to yield the force of gravity. He tried to discover \\nthe field equations for electricity and magnetism, but he died before he \\ncould finish that project. At his death, he still had no way of calculating \\nhow much crumpling would be necessary to describe the forces. These \\ncrucial developments would be left to Maxwell and Einstein. \\n\\n\\nLiving in a Space Warp \\n\\nThe spell was finally broken. \\n\\nRiemann, in his short life, lifted the spell cast by Euclid more than \\n2,000 years before. Riemann\\'s metric tensor was the weapon with which \\nyoung mathematicians could defy the Boeotians, who howled at any \\nmention of higher dimensions. Those who followed in Riemann\\'s foot- \\nsteps found it easier to speak of unseen worlds. \\n\\nSoon, research bloomed all over Europe. Prominent scientists began \\n\\n\\n\\n44 \\n\\n\\nENTERING THE FIFTH DIMENSION \\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 2.5. A two-dimensional being cannot eat. Its digestive tract necessarily \\ndivides it into two distinct pieces, and the being falls apart. \\n\\npopularizing the idea for the general public. Hermann von Helmholtz, \\nperhaps the most famous German physicist of his generation, was deeply \\naffected by Riemann\\'s work and wrote and spoke extensively to the gen- \\neral public about the mathematics of intelligent beings living on a ball \\nor sphere. \\n\\nAccording to Helmholtz, these creatures, with reasoning powers sim- \\nilar to our own, would independently discover that all of Euclid\\'s pos- \\n\\n\\n\\nMathematicians and Mystics \\n\\n\\n45 \\n\\n\\ntulates and theorems were useless. On a sphere, for example, the sums \\nof the interior angles of a triangle do not add up to 180 degrees. The \\n\"bookworms\" first talked about by Gauss now found themselves inhab- \\niting Helmholtz\\'s two-dimensional spheres. Helmholtz wrote that \"geo- \\nmetrical axioms must vary according to the kind of space inhabited by \\nbeings whose powers of reasoning are quite in conformity with ours.\"\" \\nHowever, in his Popular Lectures of Scientific Subjects (1881), Helmholtz \\nwarned his readers that it is impossible for us to visualize the fourth \\ndimension. In fact, he said \"such a \\'representation\\' is as impossible as \\nthe \\'representation\\' of colours would be to one born blind.\\'\"\" \\n\\nSome scientists, marveling at the elegance of Riemann\\'s work, tried \\nto find physical applications for such a powerful apparatus.\" While some \\nscientists were exploring the applications of higher dimension, other \\nscientists asked more practical, mundane questions, such as: How does \\na two-dimensional being eat? In order for Gauss\\'s two-dimensional peo- \\nple to eat, their mouths would have to face to the side. But if we now \\ndraw their digestive tract, we notice that this passageway completely \\nbisects their bodies (Figure 2.5). Thus if they eat, their bodies will split \\ninto two pieces. In fact, any tube that connects two openings in their \\nbodies will separate them into two unattached pieces. This presents us \\nwith a difficult choice. Either these people eat like we do and their bod- \\nies break apart, or they obey different laws of biology. \\' \\n\\nUnfortunately, the advanced mathematics of Riemann outstripped \\nthe relatively backward understanding of physics in the nineteenth cen- \\ntury. There was no physical principle to guide further research. We \\nwould have to wait another century for the physicists to catch up with \\nthe mathematicians. But this did not stop nineteenth-century scientists \\nfrom speculating endlessly about what beings from the fourth dimension \\nwould look like. Soon, they realized that such a fourth-dimensional \\nbeing would have almost God-like powers. \\n\\n\\nTo Be a God \\n\\nImagine being able to walk through walls. \\n\\nYou wouldn\\'t have to bother with opening doors; you could pass right \\nthrough them. You wouldn\\'t have to go around buildings; you could \\nenter them through their walls and pillars and out through the back \\nwall. You wouldn\\'t have to detour around mountains; you could step \\nright into them. When hungry, you could simply reach through the \\n\\n\\n\\n46 \\n\\n\\nENTERING THE FIFTH DIMENSION \\n\\n\\nrefrigerator door without opening it. You could never be accidentally \\nlocked outside your car; you could simply step through the car door. \\n\\nImagine being able to disappear or reappear at will. Instead of driv- \\ning to school or work, you wouldjust vanish and rematerialize in your \\nclassroom or office. You wouldn\\'t need an airplane to visit far-away \\nplaces, you couldjust vanish and rematerialize where you wanted. You \\nwould never be stuck in city traffic during rush hours; you and your car \\nwould simply disappear and rematerialize at your destination. \\n\\nImagine having x-ray eyes. You would be able to see accidents hap- \\npening from a distance. After vanishing and rematerializing at the site \\nof any accident, you could see exactly where the victims were, even if \\nthey were buried under debris. \\n\\nImagine being able to reach into an object without opening it. You \\ncould extract the sections from an orange without peeling or cutting it. \\nYou would be hailed as a master surgeon, with the ability to repair the \\ninternal organs of patients without ever cutting the skin, thereby greatly \\nreducing pain and the risk of infection. You would simply reach into the \\nperson\\'s body, passing directly through the skin, and perform the deli- \\ncate operation. \\n\\nImagine what a criminal could do with these powers. He could enter \\nthe most heavily guarded bank. He could see through the massive doors \\nof the vault for the valuables and cash and reach inside and pull them \\nout. He could then stroll outside as the bullets from the guards passed \\nright through him. With these powers, no prison could hold a criminal. \\n\\nNo secrets could be kept from us. No treasures could be hidden from \\nus. No obstructions could stop us. We would truly be miracle workers, \\nperforming feats beyond the comprehension of mortals. We would also \\nbe omnipotent. \\n\\nWhat being could possess such God-like power? The answer: a being \\nfrom a higher-dimensional world. Of course, these feats are beyond the \\ncapability of any three-dimensional person. For us, walls are solid and \\nprison bars are unbreakable. Attempting to walk through walls will only \\ngive us a painful, bloody nose. But for a four-dimensional being, these \\nfeats would be child\\'s play. \\n\\nTo understand how these miraculous feats can be performed, con- \\nsider again Gauss\\'s mythical two-dimensional beings, living on a two- \\ndimensional table top. Tojail a criminal, the Flatlanders simply draw a \\ncircle around him. No matter which way the criminal moves, he hits the \\nimpenetrable circle. However, it is a trivial task for us to spring the pris- \\noner from jail. We just reach down, grab the Flatlander, peel him off \\nthe two-dimensional world, and redeposit him elsewhere on his world (Fig- \\n\\n\\n\\nMathematicians and Mystics \\n\\n\\n47 \\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 2.6. In Flatland, a \"jail\" is a circle drawn around a person. Escape from \\nthis circle is impossible in two dimensions. However, a three-dimensional person \\ncan yank a Flatlander out of jail into the third dimension. To a jailer, it appears \\nas though the prisoner has mysteriously vanished into thin air. \\n\\nure 2.6). This feat, which is quite ordinary in three dimensions, appears \\nfantastic in two dimensions. \\n\\nTo hisjailer, the prisoner has suddenly disappeared from an escape- \\nproofprison, vanishing into thin air. Thenjust as suddenly, he reappears \\nsomewhere else. If you explain to the jailer that the prisoner was moved \\n\"up\" and off Flatland, he would not understand what you were saying. \\nThe word up does not exist in the Flatlander\\'s vocabulary, nor can he \\nvisualize the concept. \\n\\nThe other feats can be similarly explained. For example, notice that \\nthe internal organs (like the stomach or heart) of a Flatlander are com- \\npletely visible to us, in the same way that we can see the internal structure \\nof cells on a microscope slide. It\\'s now trivial to reach inside a Flatlander \\nand perform surgery without cutting the skin. We can also peel the Flat- \\n\\n\\n48 \\n\\n\\nENTERING THE FIFTH DIMENSION \\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 2.7. If we peel a Flatlander from his world and flip him over in three \\ndimensions, his heart now appears on the right-hand side. All his internal organs \\nhave been reversed. This transformation is a medical impossibility to someone who \\nlives strictly in Flatland. \\n\\n\\nlander off his world, flip him around, and put him back down. Notice \\nthat his left and right organs are now reversed, so that his heart is on \\nthe right side (Figure 2.7). \\n\\nViewing Flatland, notice also that we are omnipotent. Even if the \\nFlatlander hides inside a house or under the ground, we can see him \\nperfectly. Fie would regard our powers as magical; we, however, would \\nknow that not magic, but simply a more advantageous perspective, is at \\nwork. (Although such feats of \"magic\" are, in principle, possible within \\nthe realm ofhyperspace physics, we should caution, once again, that the \\ntechnology necessary to manipulate space-time far exceeds anything \\npossible on the earth, at least for hundreds ofyears. The ability to manip- \\nulate space-time maybe within the domain of only some extraterrestrial \\nlife in the universe far in advance of anything found on the earth, with \\nthe technology to master energy on a scale a quadrillion times larger \\nthan our most powerful machines.) \\n\\nAlthough Riemann\\'s famous lecture was popularized by the work of \\nHelmholtz and many others, the lay public could make little sense of \\nthis or the eating habits of two-dimensional creatures. For the average \\n\\n\\n\\nMathematicians and Mystics \\n\\n\\n49 \\n\\n\\nperson, the question was more direct: What kind of beings can walk \\nthrough walls, see through steel, and perform miracles? What kind of \\nbeings are omnipotent and obey a set of laws different from ours? \\n\\nWhy ghosts, of course! \\n\\nIn the absence of any physical principle motivating the introduction \\nof higher dimensions, the theory of the fourth dimension suddenly took \\nan unexpected turn. We will now begin a strange but important detour \\nin the history of hyperspace, examining its unexpected but profound \\nimpact on the arts and philosophy. This tour through popular culture \\nwill show how the mystics gave us clever ways in which to \"visualize\" \\nhigher-dimensional space. \\n\\n\\nGhosts from the Fourth Dimension \\n\\nThe fourth dimension penetrated the public\\'s consciousness in 1877, \\nwhen a scandalous trial in London gave it an international notoriety. \\n\\nThe London newspapers widely publicized the sensational claims \\nand bizarre trial of psychic Henry Slade. The raucous proceedings drew \\nin some of the most prominent physicists of the day. As a result of all \\nthe publicity, talk of the fourth dimension left the blackboards of \\nabstract mathematicians and burst into polite society, turning up in din- \\nner-table conversations throughout London. The \"notorious fourth \\ndimension\" was now the talk of the town. \\n\\nIt all began, innocently enough, when Slade, a psychic from the \\nUnited States, visited London and held seances with prominent towns- \\npeople. He was subsequently arrested for fraud and charged with \"using \\nsubtle crafts and devices, by palmistry and otherwise,\" to deceive his \\nclients. 1 Normally, this trial might have gone unnoticed. But London \\nsociety was scandalized and amused when eminent physicists came to his \\ndefense, claiming that his psychic feats actually proved that he could \\nsummon spirits living in the fourth dimension. This scandal was fueled \\nby the fact that Slade\\'s defenders were not ordinary British scientists, \\nbut rather some of the greatest physicists in the world. Many went on to \\nwin the Nobel Prize in physics. \\n\\nPlaying a leading role in stirring up this scandal was Johann Zollner, \\na professor of physics and astronomy at the University of Leipzig. It was \\nZollner who marshaled a galaxy of leading physicists to come to Slade\\'s \\ndefense. \\n\\nThat mystics could perform parlor tricks for the royal court and \\nproper society, of course, was nothing new. For centuries, they had \\n\\n\\n\\n50 \\n\\n\\nENTERING THE FIFTH DIMENSION \\n\\n\\nclaimed that they could summon spirits to read the writing within closed \\nenvelopes, pull objects from closed bottles, reseal broken match sticks, \\nand intertwine rings. The strange twist to this trial was that leading sci- \\nentists claimed these feats were possible by manipulating objects in the \\nfourth dimension. In the process, they gave the public its first under- \\nstanding of how to perform these miraculous feats via the fourth dimen- \\nsion. \\n\\nZollner enlisted the help of internationally prominent physicists who \\nparticipated in the Society for Psychical Research and who even rose to \\nlead the organization, including some of the most distinguished names \\nof nineteenth-century physics: William Crookes, inventor of the cathode \\nray tube, which today is used in every television set and computer mon- \\nitor in the world;\" Wilhelm Weber, Gauss\\'s collaborator and the mentor \\nof Riemann (today, the international unit of magnetism is officially \\nnamed the \"weber\" after him); J. J. Thompson, who won the Nobel \\nPrize in 1906 for the discovery of the electron; and Lord Rayleigh, rec- \\nognized by historians as one of the greatest classical physicists of the late \\nnineteenth century and winner of the Nobel Prize in physics in 1904. \\n\\nCrookes, Weber, and Zollner, in particular, took a special interest in \\nthe work of Slade, who was eventually convicted of fraud by the court. \\nHowever, he insisted that he could prove his innocence by duplicating \\nhis feats before a scientific body. Intrigued, Zollner took up the chal- \\nlenge. A number of controlled experiments were conducted in 1877 to \\ntest Slade\\'s ability to send objects through the fourth dimension. Several \\ndistinguished scientists were invited by Zollner to evaluate Slade\\'s abili- \\nties. \\n\\nFirst, Slade was given two separate, unbroken wooden rings. Could \\nhe push one wooden ring past the other, so that they were intertwined \\nwithout breaking? If Slade succeeded, Zollner wrote, it would \"represent \\na miracle, that is, a phenomenon which our conceptions heretofore of \\nphysical and organic processes would be absolutely incompetent to \\nexplain. \" \\xe2\\x80\\x9c \\n\\nSecond, he was given the shell of a sea snail, which twisted either to \\nthe right or to the left. Could Slade transform a right-handed shell into \\na left-handed shell and vice versa? \\n\\nThird, he was given a closed loop of rope made of dried animal gut. \\nCould he make a knot in the circular rope without cutting it? \\n\\nSlade was also given variations of these tests. For example, a rope was \\ntied into a right-handed knot and its ends were sealed with wax and \\nimpressed with Zollner\\'s personal seal. Slade was asked to untie the knot, \\nwithout breaking the wax seal, and retie the rope in a left-handed knot. \\n\\n\\n\\nMathematicians and Mystics \\n\\n\\n51 \\n\\n\\nSince knots can always be untied in the fourth dimension, this feat \\nshould be easy for a fourth-dimensional person. Slade was also asked to \\nremove the contents of a sealed bottle without breaking the bottle. \\n\\nCould Slade demonstrate this astounding ability? \\n\\nMagic in the Fourth Dimension \\n\\nToday we realize that the manipulation of higher-dimensional space, as \\nclaimed by Slade, would require a technology far in advance of anything \\npossible on this planet for the conceivable future. However, what is inter- \\nesting about this notorious case is that Zollner correctly concluded that \\nSlade\\'s feats of wizardry could be explained if one could somehow move \\nobjects through the fourth dimension. Thus for pedagogical reasons, \\nthe experiments of Zollner are compelling and worth discussing. \\n\\nFor example, in three dimensions, separate rings cannot be pushed \\nthrough each other until they intertwine without breaking them. Simi- \\nlarly, closed, circular pieces of rope cannot be twisted into knots without \\ncutting them. Any Boy or Girl Scout who has struggled with knots for \\nhis or her merit badges knows that knots in a circular loop of rope \\ncannot be removed. However, in higher dimensions, knots are easily \\nunraveled and rings can be intertwined. This is because there is \"more \\nroom\" in which to move ropes past each other and rings into each other. \\nIf the fourth dimension existed, ropes and rings could be lifted off our \\nuniverse, intertwined, and then returned to our world. In fact, in the \\nfourth dimension, knots can never remain tied. They can always be \\nunraveled without cutting the rope. This feat is impossible in three \\ndimensions, but trivial in the fourth. The third dimension, as it turns \\nout, is the only dimension in which knots stay knotted. (The proof of \\nthis rather unexpected result is given in the notes. 1 \\') \\n\\nSimilarly, in three dimensions it is impossible to convert a rigid left- \\nhanded object into a right-handed one. Humans are born with hearts \\non their left side, and no surgeon, no matter now skilled, can reverse \\nhuman internal organs. This is possible (as first pointed out by mathe- \\nmatician August Mobius in 1827) only if we lift the body out of our \\nuniverse, rotate it in the fourth dimension, and then reinsert it back into \\nour universe. Two of these tricks are depicted in Figure 2.8; they can be \\nperformed only if objects can be moved in the fourth dimension. \\n\\nPolarizing the Scientific Community \\n\\nZollner sparked a storm of controversy when, publishing in both the \\nQuarterly Journal of Science and Transcendental Physics, he claimed that \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMathematicians and Mystics \\n\\n\\nS3 \\n\\n\\nSlade amazed his audiences with these \"miraculous\" feats during \\nseances in the presence of distinguished scientists. (However, Slade also \\nflunked some of the tests that were conducted under controlled condi- \\ntions.) \\n\\nZollner\\'s spirited defense of Slade\\'s feats was sensationalized \\nthroughout London society. (In fact, this was actually one of several \\nhighly publicized incidents involving spiritualists and mediums in the \\nlate nineteenth century. Victorian England was apparently fascinated \\nwith the occult.) Scientists, as well as the general public, quickly took \\nsides in the matter. Supporting Zollner\\'s claims was his circle of repu- \\ntable scientists, including Weber and Crookes. These were not average \\nscientists, but masters of the art of science and seasoned observers of \\nexperiment. They had spent a lifetime working with natural phenomena, \\nand now before their eyes, Slade was performing feats that were possible \\nonly if spirits lived in the fourth dimension. \\n\\nBut detractors ofZollner pointed out that scientists, because they are \\ntrained to trust their senses, are the worst possible people to evaluate a \\nmagician. A magician is trained specifically to distract, deceive, and con- \\nfuse those very senses. A scientist may carefully observe the magician\\'s \\nright hand, but it is the left hand that secretly performs the trick. Critics \\nalso pointed out that only another magician is clever enough to detect \\nthe sleight-of-hand tricks of a fellow magician. Only a thief can catch a \\nthief. \\n\\nOne particularly savage piece of criticism, published in the science \\nquarterly magazine Bedrock, was made against two other prominent phys- \\nicists, Sir W. F. Barrett and Sir Oliver Lodge, and their work on telepathy. \\nThe article was merciless: \\n\\n\\nIt is not necessary either to regard the phenomena of so-called telepathy \\nas inexplicable or to regard the mental condition of Sir W. F. Barrett and \\nSir Oliver Lodge as indistinguishable from idiocy. There is a third possi- \\nbility. The will to believe has made them ready to accept evidence obtained \\nunder conditions which they would recognize to be unsound if they had \\nbeen trained in experimental psychology. \\n\\nOver a century later, precisely the same arguments, pro and con, \\nwould be used in the debate over the feats of the Israeli psychic Uri \\nGeller, who convinced two reputable scientists at the Stanford Research \\nInstitute in California that he could bend keys by mental power alone \\nand perform other miracles. (Commenting on this, some scientists have \\nrepeated a saying that dates back to the Romans: \"Populus vult decipi. \\n\\n\\n\\n54 \\n\\n\\nENTERING THE FIFTH DIMENSION \\n\\n\\nergo decipiatur\" [People want to be deceived, therefore let them be \\ndeceived].) \\n\\nThe passions raging within the British scientific community touched \\noff a lively debate that quickly spread across the English Channel. Unfor- \\ntunately, in the decades following Riemann\\'s death, scientists lost sight \\nof his original goal, to simplify the laws of nature through higher dimen- \\nsions. As a consequence, the theory of higher dimensions wandered into \\nmany interesting but questionable directions. This is an important les- \\nson. Without a clear physical motivation or a guiding physical picture, \\npure mathematical concepts sometimes drift into speculation. \\n\\nThese decades were not a complete loss, however, because mathe- \\nmaticians and mystics like Charles Hinton would invent ingenious ways \\nin which to \"see\" the fourth dimension. Eventually, the pervasive influ- \\nence of the fourth dimension would come full circle and cross-pollinate \\nthe world of physics once again. \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Man Who \"Saw\" \\nthe Fourth Dimension \\n\\n\\n[T]he fourth dimension had become almost a household \\nword by 1910. . . .

Schofield, in his 1888 book Another World, argued at length that God and the spirits \\nresided in the fourth dimension. 1 Not to be outdone, in 1893 the theologian Arthur Willink \\nwrote The World of the Unseen, in which he claimed that it was unworthy of God to reside in \\nthe lowly fourth dimension. Willink claimed that the only domain magnificent enough for \\nGod was infinite-dimensional space.\\' 2 \\n\\n\\n56 \\n\\n\\nENTERING THE FIFTH DIMENSION \\n\\n\\nsions, the book was an instant success in England, with nine successive \\nreprintings by the year 1915, and editions too numerous to count today. \\n\\nWhat was surprising about the novel Flatland was that Abbott, for the \\nfirst time, used the controversy surrounding the fourth dimension as a \\nvehicle for biting social criticism and satire. Abbot took a playful swipe \\nat the rigid, pious individuals who refused to admit the possibility of \\nother worlds. The \"bookworms\" of Gauss became the Flatlanders. The \\nBoeotians whom Gauss so feared became the High Priests, who would \\npersecute \\xe2\\x80\\x94 with the vigor and impartiality of the Spanish Inquisition \\xe2\\x80\\x94 \\nanyone who dared mention the unseen third dimension. \\n\\nAbbot\\'s Flatland is a thinly disguised criticism of the subtle bigotry \\nand suffocating prejudice prevalent in Victorian England. The hero of \\nthe novel is Mr. Square, a conservative gentleman who lives in a socially \\nstratified, two-dimensional land where everyone is a geometric object. \\nWomen, occupying the lowest rank in the social hierarchy, are mere \\nlines, the nobility are polygons, while the High Priests are circles. The \\nmore sides people have, the higher their social rank. \\n\\nDiscussion of the third dimension is strictly forbidden. Anyone men- \\ntioning it is sentenced to severe punishment. Mr. Square is a smug, self- \\nrighteous person who would never think of challenging the Establish- \\nment for its injustices. One day, however, his life is permanently turned \\nupside down when he is visited by a mysterious Lord Sphere, a three- \\ndimensional sphere. Lord Sphere appears to Mr. Square as a circle that \\ncan magically change size (Figure 3.1) \\n\\nLord Sphere patiently tries to explain that he comes from another \\nworld called Spaceland, where all objects have three dimensions. How- \\never, Mr. Square remains unconvinced; he stubbornly resists the idea \\nthat a third dimension can exist. Frustrated, Lord Sphere decides to \\nresort to deeds, not mere words. He then peels Mr. Square off the two- \\ndimensional Flatland and hurls him into Spaceland. It is a fantastic, \\nalmost mystical experience that changes Mr. Square\\'s life. \\n\\nAs the flat Mr. Square floats in the third dimension like a sheet of \\npaper drifting in the wind, he can visualize only two-dimensional slices \\nof Spaceland. Mr. Square, seeing only the cross sections of three-dimen- \\nsional objects, views a fantastic world where objects change shape and \\neven appear and disappear into thin air. However, when he tries to tell \\nhis fellow Flatlanders of the marvels he saw in his visit to the third dimen- \\nsion, the High Priests consider him a blabbering, seditious maniac. Mr. \\nSquare becomes a threat to the High Priests because he dares to chal- \\nlenge their authority and their sacred belief that only two dimensions \\ncan possibly exist. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 3.1. In Flatland, Mr. Square encounters Lord Sphere. As Lord Sphere \\npasses through Flatland , he appears to be a circle that becomes successivley larger \\nand then smaller. Thus Flatlanders cannot visualize three-dimensional beings, \\nbut can understand their cross sections. \\n\\n\\n57 \\n\\n\\n58 \\n\\n\\nENTERING THE FIFTH DIMENSION \\n\\n\\nThe book ends on a pessimistic note. Although he is convinced that \\nhe did, indeed, visit the third-dimensional world of Spaceland, Mr. \\nSquare is sent to jail and condemned to spend the rest of his days in \\nsolitary confinement. \\n\\n\\nA Dinner Party in the Fourth Dimension \\n\\nAbbot\\'s novel is important because it was the first widely read popular- \\nization of a visit to a higher-dimensional world. His description of Mr. \\nSquare\\'s psychedelic trip into Spaceland is mathematically correct. In \\npopular accounts and the movies, interdimensional travel through \\nhyperspace is often pictured with blinking lights and dark, swirling \\nclouds. However, the mathematics of higher-dimensional travel is much \\nmore interesting than the imagination of fiction writers. To visualize \\nwhat an interdimensional trip would look like, imagine peeling Mr. \\nSquare off Flatland and throwing him into the air. As he floats through \\nour three-dimensional world, let\\'s say that he comes across a human \\nbeing. What do we look like to Mr. Square? \\n\\nBecause his two-dimensional eyes can see only flat slices of our world, \\na human would look like a singularly ugly and frightening object. First, \\nhe might see two leather circles hovering in front of him (our shoes). \\nAs he drifts upward, these two circles change color and turn into cloth \\n(our pants). Then these two circles coalesce into one circle (our waist) \\nand split into three circles of cloth and change color again (our shirt \\nand our arms). As he continues to float upward, these three circles of \\ncloth merge into one smaller circle of flesh (our neck and head). Finally, \\nthis circle of flesh turns into a mass ofhair, and then abruptly disappears \\nas Mr. Square floats above our heads. To Mr. Square, these mysterious \\n\"humans\" are a nightmarish, maddeningly confusing collection of con- \\nstantly changing circles made of leather, cloth, flesh, and hair. \\n\\nSimilarly, if we were peeled off our three-dimensional universe and \\nhurled into the fourth dimension, we would find that common sense \\nbecomes useless. As we drift through the fourth dimension, blobs appear \\nfrom nowhere in front of our eyes. They constantly change in color, size, \\nand composition, defying all the rules of logic of our three-dimensional \\nworld. And they disappear into thin air, to be replaced by other hovering \\nblobs. \\n\\nIf we were invited to a dinner party in the fourth dimension, how \\nwould we tell the creatures apart? We would have to recognize them by \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Man Who \"Saw\" the Fourth Dimension \\n\\n\\n59 \\n\\n\\nthe differences in how these blobs change. Each person in higher dimen- \\nsions would have his or her own characteristic sequences of changing \\nblobs. Over a period of time, we would learn to tell these creatures \\napart by recognizing their distinctive patterns of changing blobs and \\ncolors. Attending dinner parties in hyperspace might be a trying exper- \\nience. \\n\\n\\nClass Struggle in the Fourth Dimension \\n\\nThe concept of the fourth dimension had so pervasively infected the \\nintellectual climate by the late nineteenth century that even playwrights \\npoked fun at it. In 1891, Oscar Wilde wrote a spoof on these ghost stories, \\n\"The Canterville Ghost,\" which lampoons the exploits of a certain gul- \\nlible \"Psychical Society\" (a thinly veiled reference to Crookes\\'s Society \\nfor Psychical Research). Wilde wrote of a long-suffering ghost who \\nencounters the newly arrived American tenants of Canterville. Wilde \\nwrote, \"There was evidently no time to be lost, so hastily adopting the \\nFourth Dimension of Space as a means of escape, he [the ghost] van- \\nished through the wainscoting and the house became quiet.\" \\n\\nA more serious contribution to the literature of the fourth dimension \\nwas the work of H. G. Wells. Although he is principally remembered for \\nhis works in science fiction, he was a dominant figure in the intellectual \\nlife of London society, noted for his literary criticism, reviews, and pierc- \\ning wit. In his 1894 novel. The Time Machine, he combined several math- \\nematical, philosophical, and political themes. He popularized a new idea \\nin science \\xe2\\x80\\x94 that the fourth dimension might also be viewed as time, not \\nnecessarily space:* \\n\\nClearly . .. any real body must have extension in four directions: it must \\nhave Length, Breadth, Thickness, and \\xe2\\x80\\x94 Duration. But through a natural \\ninfirmity of the flesh ... we incline to overlook this fact. There are really \\nfour dimensions, three which we call the three lanes of Space, and a \\nFourth, Time. There is, however, a tendency to draw an unreal distinction \\nbetween the former three dimensions and the latter, because it happens \\nthat our consciousness moves intermittently in one direction along the \\nlatter from the beginning to the end of our lives.\\' \\n\\n\\n*Wells was not the first to speculate that time could he viewed as a new type of fourth \\ndimension, different from a spatial one. Jean d\\'Alembert had considered time as the fourth \\ndimension in his 1754 article \"Dimension.\" \\n\\n\\n\\n60 \\n\\n\\nENTERING THE FIFTH DIMENSION \\n\\n\\nLike Flatland before it, what makes The Time Machine so enduring, \\neven a century after its conception, is its sharp political and social cri- \\ntique. England in the year 802,701, Wells\\'s protagonist finds, is not the \\ngleaming citadel of modern scientific marvels that the positivists fore- \\ntold. Instead, the future England is a land where the class struggle went \\nawry. The working class was cruelly forced to live underground, until \\nthe workers mutated into a new, brutish species ofhuman, the Morlocks, \\nwhile the ruling class, with its unbridled debauchery, deteriorated and \\nevolved into the useless race of elflike creatures, the Eloi. \\n\\nWells, a prominent Fabian socialist, was using the fourth dimension \\nto reveal the ultimate irony of the class struggle. The social contract \\nbetween the poor and the rich had gone completely mad. The useless \\nEloi are fed and clothed by the hard-working Morlocks, but the workers \\nget the final revenge: The Morlocks eat the Eloi. The fourth dimension, \\nin other words, became a foil for a Marxist critique of modern society, \\nbut with a novel twist: The working class will not break the chains of the \\nrich, as Marx predicted. They will eat the rich. \\n\\nIn a short story, \"The Plattner Story,\" Wells even toyed with the \\nparadox of handedness. Gottfried Plattner, a science teacher, is perform- \\ning an elaborate chemical experiment, but his experiment blows up and \\nsends him into another universe. When he returns from the netherworld \\nto the real world, he discovers that his body has been altered in a curious \\nfashion: His heart is now on his right side, and he is now left handed. \\nWhen they examine him, his doctors are stunned to find that Planner\\'s \\nentire body has been reversed, a biological impossibility in our three- \\ndimensional world: \"[T]he curious inversion ofPlanner\\'s right and left \\nsides is proof that he has moved out of our space into what is called the \\nFourth Dimension, and that he has returned again to our world.\" How- \\never, Plattner resists the idea of a postmortem dissection after his death, \\nthereby postponing \"perhaps forever, the positive proof that his entire \\nbody had had its left and right sides transposed.\" \\n\\nWells was well aware that there are two ways to visualize how left- \\nhanded objects can be transformed into right-handed objects. A Flat- \\nlander, for example, can be lifted out of his world, flipped over, and \\nthen placed back in Flatland, thereby reversing his organs. Or the Flat- \\nlander may live on a Mobius strip, created by twisting a strip of paper \\n180 degrees and then gluing the ends together. If a Flatlander walks \\ncompletely around the Mobius strip and returns, he finds that his organs \\nhave been reversed (Figure 3.2). Mobius strips have other remarkable \\nproperties that have fascinated scientists over the past century. For exam- \\nple, if you walk completely around the surface, you will find that it has \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Man Who \"Saw\" the Fourth Dimension \\n\\n\\n61 \\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 3.2. A Mobius strip is a strip with only one side. Its outside and inside \\nare identical. If a Flatlander wanders around a Mobius strip, his internal organs \\nwill be reversed. \\n\\n\\nonly one side. Also, if you cut it in half along the center strip, it remains \\nin one piece. This has given rise to the mathematicians\\' limerick: \\n\\nA mathematician confided \\nThat a Mobius band is one-sided \\nAnd you\\'ll get quite a laugh \\nIf you cut it in half. \\n\\nFor it stays in one piece when divided. \\n\\nIn his classic The Invisible Man, Wells speculated that a man might \\neven become invisible by some trick involving \"a formula, a geometrical \\nexpression involving four dimensions.\" Wells knew that a Flatlander dis- \\nappears if he is peeled off his two-dimensional universe; similarly, a man \\ncould become invisible if he could somehow leap into the fourth dimen- \\nsion. \\n\\nIn the short story \"The Remarkable Case of Davidson\\'s Eyes,\" Wells \\nexplored the idea that a \"kink in space\" might enable an individual to \\n\\n\\n\\n62 \\n\\n\\nENTERING THE FIFTH DIMENSION \\n\\n\\nsee across vast distances. Davidson, the hero of the story, one day finds \\nhe has the disturbing power of being able to see events transpiring on \\na distant South Sea island. This \"kink in space\" is a space warp whereby \\nlight from the South Seas goes through hyperspace and enters his eyes \\nin England. Thus Wells used Riemann\\'s wormholes as a literary device \\nin his fiction. \\n\\nIn The Wonderful Visit, Wells explored the possibility that heaven exists \\nin a parallel world or dimension. The plot revolves around the predic- \\nament of an angel who accidentally falls from heaven and lands in an \\nEnglish country village. \\n\\nThe popularity of Wells\\'s work opened up a new genre of fiction. \\nGeorge McDonald, a friend of mathematician Lewis Carroll, also spec- \\nulated about the possibility ofheaven being located in the fourth dimen- \\nsion. In McDonald\\'s fantasy Lilith, written in 1895, the hero creates a \\ndimensional window between our universe and other worlds by manip- \\nulating mirror reflections. And in the 1901 story The Inheritors by Joseph \\nConrad and Ford Madox Ford, a race of supermen from the fourth \\ndimension enters into our world. Cruel and unfeeling, these supermen \\nbegin to take over the world. \\n\\n\\nThe Fourth Dimension as Art \\n\\nThe years 1890 to 1910 may be considered the Golden Years of the \\nFourth Dimension. It was a time during which the ideas originated by \\nGauss and Riemann permeated literary circles, the avant garde, and the \\nthoughts of the general public, affecting trends in art, literature, and \\nphilosophy. The new branch of philosophy, called Theosophy, was \\ndeeply influenced by higher dimensions. \\n\\nOn the one hand, serious scientists regretted this development \\nbecause the rigorous results of Riemann were now being dragged \\nthrough tabloid headlines. On the other hand, the popularization of the \\nfourth dimension had a positive side. Not only did it make the advances \\nin mathematics available to the general public, but it also served as a \\nmetaphor that could enrich and cross-fertilize cultural currents. \\n\\nArt historian Linda Dalrymple Henderson, writing in The Fourth \\nDimension and Noil-Euclidean Geometry in Modern Art, elaborates on this \\nand argues that the fourth dimension crucially influenced the develop- \\nment of Cubism and Expressionism in the art world. She writes that \"it \\nwas among the Cubists that the first and most coherent art theory based \\non the new geometries was developed.\\'\" To the avant garde, the fourth \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Man Who \"Saw\" the Fourth Dimension \\n\\n\\n63 \\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 3.3. One scene in the Bayeux Tapestry depicts frightened English troops \\npointing to an apparition in the sky (Halley\\'s comet). The figures are flat, as in \\nmost of the art done in the Middle Ages. This signified that God was omnipotent. \\nPictures were thus drawn two dimensionally. (Giraudon/Art Resource ) \\n\\n\\ndimension symbolized the revolt against the excesses of capitalism. They \\nsaw its oppressive positivism and vulgar materialism as stifling creative \\nexpression. The Cubists, for example, rebelled against the insufferable \\narrogance of the zealots of science whom they perceived as dehuman- \\nizing the creative process. \\n\\nThe avant garde seized on the fourth dimension as their vehicle. On \\nthe one hand, the fourth dimension pushed the boundaries of modern \\nscience to their limit. It was more scientific than the scientists. On the \\nother hand, it was mysterious. And flaunting the fourth dimension \\ntweaked the noses of the stiff, know-it-all positivists. In particular, this \\ntook the form of an artistic revolt against the laws of perspective. \\n\\nIn the Middle Ages, religious art was distinctive for its deliberate lack \\nof perspective. Serfs, peasants, and kings were depicted as though they \\nwere flat, much in the way children draw people. These paintings largely \\nreflected the church\\'s view that God was omnipotent and could there- \\nfore see all parts of our world equally. Art had to reflect his point of \\nview, so the world was painted two dimensionally. For example, the \\nfamous Bayeux Tapestry (Figure 3.3) depicts the superstitious soldiers \\nof King Harold II of England pointing in frightened wonder at an omi- \\n\\n\\n\\n64 \\n\\n\\nENTERING THE FIFTH DIMENSION \\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 3.4. During the Renaissance, painters discovered the third dimension. \\nPictures were painted with perspective and were viewed from the vantage point of \\na single eye, not God\\'s eye. Note that all the lines in Leonardo da Vinci\\'s fresco \\nThe Last Supper converge to a point at the horizon. (Bettmann Archive ) \\n\\n\\nnous comet soaring overhead in April 1066, convinced that it is an omen \\nof impending defeat. (Six centuries later, the same comet would be \\nchristened Halley\\'s comet.) Harold subsequently lost the crucial Battle \\nof Hastings to William the Conqueror, who was crowned the king of \\nEngland, and a new chapter in English history began. However, the \\nBayeux Tapestry, like other medieval works of art, depicts Harold\\'s sol- \\ndiers\\' arms and faces as flat, as though a plane of glass had been placed \\nover their bodies, compressing them against the tapestry. \\n\\nRenaissance art was a revolt against this flat God-centered perspec- \\ntive, and man-centered art began to flourish, with sweeping landscapes \\nand realistic, three-dimensional people painted from the point of view \\nof a person\\'s eye. In Leonardo da Vinci\\'s powerful studies on perspec- \\ntive, we see the lines in his sketches vanishing into a single point on the \\nhorizon. Renaissance art reflected the way the eye viewed the world, \\nfrom the singular point of view of the observer. In Michelangelo\\'s fres- \\ncoes or in da Vinci\\'s sketch book, we see bold, imposing figures jumping \\nout of the second dimension. In other words. Renaissance art discovered \\nthe third dimension (Figure 3.4). \\n\\nWith the beginning of the machine age and capitalism, the artistic \\nworld revolted against the cold materialism that seemed to dominate \\n\\n\\nThe Man Who \"Saw\" the Fourth Dimension \\n\\n\\n65 \\n\\n\\nindustrial society. To the Cubists, positivism was a straitjacket that con- \\nfined us to what could be measured in the laboratory, suppressing the \\nfruits of our imagination. They asked: Why must art be clinically \"real- \\nistic\"? This Cubist \"revolt against perspective\" seized the fourth dimen- \\nsion because it touched the third dimension from all possible perspec- \\ntives. Simply put. Cubist art embraced the fourth dimension. \\n\\nPicasso\\'s paintings are a splendid example, showing a clear rejection \\nof the perspective, with women\\'s faces viewed simultaneously from sev- \\neral angles. Instead of a single point of view, Picasso\\'s paintings show \\nmultiple perspectives, as though they were painted by someone from the \\nfourth dimension, able to see all perspectives simultaneously (Figure \\n3.5). \\n\\nPicasso was once accosted on a train by a stranger who recognized \\nhim. The stranger complained: Why couldn\\'t he draw pictures of people \\nthe way they actually were? Why did he have to distort the way people \\nlooked? Picasso then asked the man to show him pictures of his family. \\nAfter gazing at the snapshot, Picasso replied, \"Oh, is your wife really \\nthat small and flat?\" To Picasso, any picture, no matter how \"realistic,\" \\ndepended on the perspective of the observer. \\n\\nAbstract painters tried not only to visualize people\\'s faces as though \\npainted by a four-dimensional person, but also to treat time as the fourth \\ndimension. In Marcel Duchamp\\'s painting Nude Descending a Staircase, \\nwe see a blurred representation of a woman, with an infinite number of \\nher images superimposed over time as she walks down the stairs. This is \\nhow a four-dimensional person would see people, viewing all time \\nsequences at once, if time were the fourth dimension. \\n\\nIn 1937, art critic Meyer Schapiro summarized the influence of these \\nnew geometries on the art world when he wrote, \"Just as the discovery \\nof non-Euclidean geometry gave a powerful impetus to the view that \\nmathematics was independent of existence, so abstract painting cut at \\nthe roots of the classic ideas of artistic imitation.\" Or, as art historian \\nLinda Henderson has said, \"the fourth dimension and non-Euclidean \\ngeometry emerge as among the most important themes unifying much \\nof modern art and theory.\"\\xe2\\x80\\x99 \\n\\n\\nBolsheviks and the Fourth Dimension \\n\\n\\nThe fourth dimension also crossed over into Czarist Russia via the writ- \\nings of the mystic P. D. Ouspensky, who introduced Russian intellectuals \\nto its mysteries. His influence was so pronounced that even Fyodor Dos- \\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 3.5. Cubism was heavily influenced by the fourth dimension. For example, \\nit tried to view reality through the eyes of a fourth-dimensional person. Such a \\nbeing, looking at a human face, would see all angles simultaneously. Hence, both \\neyes would be seen at once by a fourth-dimensional being, as in Picasso \\'s painting \\nPortrait of Dora Maar. (Giraudon/Art Resource. \\xc2\\xae 1993. Ars, New York/ \\nSpadem, Paris ) \\n\\n\\n66 \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Man Who \"Saw\" the Fourth Dimension \\n\\n\\n67 \\n\\n\\ntoyevsky, in The Brothers Karamazov, had his protagonist Ivan Karamazov \\nspeculate on the existence of higher dimensions and non-Euclidean \\ngeometries during a discussion on the existence of God. \\n\\nBecause of the historic events unfolding in Russia, the fourth dimen- \\nsion was to play a curious role in the Bolshevik Revolution. Today, this \\nstrange interlude in the history of science is important because Vladimir \\nLenin would join the debate over the fourth dimension, which would \\neventually exert a powerful influence on the science of the former Soviet \\nUnion for the next 70 years.\" (Russian physicists, of course, have played \\nkey roles in developing the present-day ten-dimensional theory.) \\n\\nAfter the Czar brutally crushed the 1905 revolution, a faction called \\nthe Otzovists, or \"God-builders,\" developed within the Bolshevik party. \\nThey argued that the peasants weren\\'t ready for socialism; to prepare \\nthem, Bolsheviks should appeal to them through religion and spiritu- \\nalism. To bolster their heretical views, the God-builders quoted from the \\nwork of the German physicist and philosopher Ernst Mach, who had \\nwritten eloquently about the fourth dimension and the recent discovery \\nof a new, unearthly property of matter called radioactivity. The God- \\nbuilders pointed out that the discovery of radioactivity by the French \\nscientist Henri Becquerel in 1896 and the discovery of radium by Marie \\nCurie in 1896 had ignited a furious philosophical debate in French and \\nGerman literary circles. It appeared that matter could slowly disintegrate \\nand that energy (in the form of radiation) could reappear. \\n\\nWithout question, the new experiments on radiation showed that the \\nfoundation of Newtonian physics was crumbling. Matter, thought by the \\nGreeks to be eternal and immutable, was now disintegrating before our \\nvery eyes. Uranium and radium, confounding accepted belief, were \\nmutating in the laboratory. To some, Mach was the prophet who would \\nlead them out of the wilderness. However, he pointed in the wrong \\ndirection, rejecting materialism and declaring that space and time were \\nproducts of our sensations. In vain, he wrote, \"I hope that nobody will \\ndefend ghost-stories with the help of what I have said and written on this \\nsubject.\" 7 \\n\\nA split developed within the Bolsheviks. Their leader. Vladimir \\nLenin, was horrified. Are ghosts and demons compatible with socialism? \\nIn exile in Geneva in 1908, he wrote a mammoth philosophical tome, \\nMaterialism and Empirio-Criticism, defending dialectical materialism from \\nthe onslaught of mysticism and metaphysics. To Lenin, the mysterious \\ndisappearance of matter and energy did not prove the existence of spir- \\nits. He argued that this meant instead that a new dialectic was emerging, \\nwhich would embrace both matter and energy. No longer could they be \\n\\n\\n\\n68 \\n\\n\\nENTERING THE FIFTH DIMENSION \\n\\n\\nviewed as separate entities, as Newton had done. They must now be \\nviewed as two poles of a dialectical unity. A new conservation principle \\nwas needed. (Unknown to Lenin, Einstein had proposed the correct \\nprinciple 3 years earlier, in 1905.) Furthermore, Lenin questioned \\nMach\\'s easy embrace of the fourth dimension. First, Lenin praised Mach, \\nwho \"has raised the very important and useful question of a space of n \\ndimensions as a conceivable space.\" Then he took Mach to task for \\nfailing to emphasize that only the three dimensions of space could be \\nverified experimentally. Mathematics may explore the fourth dimension \\nand the world of what is possible, and this is good, wrote Lenin, but the \\nCzar can be overthrown only in the third dimension!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 \\n\\nFighting on the battleground of the fourth dimension and the new \\ntheory of radiation, Lenin needed years to root out Otzovism from the \\nBolshevik party. Nevertheless, he won the battle shortly before the out- \\nbreak of the 1917 October Revolution. \\n\\n\\nBigamists and the Fourth Dimension \\n\\nEventually, the ideas of the fourth dimension crossed the Atlantic and \\ncame to America. Their messenger was a colorful English mathematician \\nnamed Charles Ftoward Flinton. While Albert Einstein was toiling at his \\ndesk job in the Swiss patent office in 1905, discovering the laws of rela- \\ntivity, Flinton was working at the United States Patent Office in Wash- \\nington, D.C. Although they probably never met, their paths would cross \\nin several interesting ways. \\n\\nFlinton spent his entire adult life obsessed with the notion of popu- \\nlarizing and visualizing the fourth dimension. Fie would go down in the \\nhistory of science as the man who \"saw\" the fourth dimension. \\n\\nFlinton was the son of James Hinton, a renowned British ear surgeon \\nof liberal persuasion. Over the years, the charismatic elder Hinton \\nevolved into a religious philosopher, an outspoken advocate of free love \\nand open polygamy, and finally the leader of an influential cult in \\nEngland. He was surrounded by a fiercely loyal and devoted circle of \\nfree-thinking followers. One of his best-known remarks was \"Christ was \\nthe Savior of men, but I am the savior of women, and I don\\'t envy Him \\na bit!\"\\xe2\\x80\\x99 \\n\\nHis son Charles, however, seemed doomed to lead a respectable, \\nboring life as a mathematician. He was fascinated not by polygamy, but \\nby polygons! Having graduated from Oxford in 1877, he became a \\nrespectable master at the Uppingham School while working on his mas- \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Man Who \"Saw\" the Fourth Dimension \\n\\n\\n69 \\n\\n\\nter\\'s degree in mathematics. At Oxford, Hinton became intrigued with \\ntrying to visualize the fourth dimension. As a mathematician, he knew \\nthat one cannot visualize a four-dimensional object in its entirety. How- \\never, it is possible, he reasoned, to visualize the cross section or the \\nunraveling of a four-dimensional object. \\n\\nHinton published his notions in the popular press. He wrote the \\ninfluential article \"What is the Fourth Dimension?\" for the Dublin Uni- \\nversity Magazine and the Cheltenham Ladies\\' College Magazine, reprinted in \\n1884 with the catchy subtitle \"Ghosts Explained.\" \\n\\nHinton\\'s life as a comfortable academic, however, took a sharp turn \\nfor the worse in 1885 when he was arrested for bigamy and put on trial. \\nEarlier, Hinton had married Mary Everest Boole, the daughter of a mem- \\nber of his father\\'s circle, and widow of the great mathematician George \\nBoole (founder of Boolean algebra). However, he was also the father of \\ntwins born to a certain Maude Weldon. \\n\\nThe headmaster at Uppingham, noticing Hinton in the presence of \\nhis wife, Mary, and his mistress, Maude, had assumed that Maude was \\nHinton\\'s sister. All was going well for Hinton, until he made the mistake \\nof marrying Maude as well. When the headmaster learned that Hinton \\nwas a bigamist, it set off a scandal. He was promptly fired from hisjob \\nat Uppingham and placed on trial for bigamy. He was imprisoned for 3 \\ndays, but Mary Hinton declined to press charges and together they left \\nEngland for the United States. \\n\\nHinton was hired as an instructor in the mathematics department at \\nPrinceton University, where his obsession with the fourth dimension was \\ntemporarily sidetracked when he invented the baseball machine. The \\nPrinceton baseball team benefited from Hinton\\'s machine, which could \\nfire baseballs at 70 miles per hour. The descendants of Hinton\\'s creation \\ncan now be found on every major baseball field in the world. \\n\\nHinton was eventually fired from Princeton, but managed to get a \\njob at the United States Naval Observatory through the influence of its \\ndirector, a devout advocate of the fourth dimension. Then, in 1902, he \\ntook ajob at the Patent Office in Washington. \\n\\n\\nHinton\\'s Cubes \\n\\nHinton spent years developing ingenious methods by which the average \\nperson and a growing legion of followers, not only professional mathe- \\nmaticians, could \"see\" four-dimensional objects. Eventually, he per- \\nfected special cubes that, if one tried hard enough, could allow one to \\n\\n\\n\\n70 \\n\\n\\nENTERING THE FIFTH DIMENSION \\n\\n\\nvisualize hypercubes, or cubes in four dimensions. These would even- \\ntually be called Hinton\\'s cubes. Hinton even coined the official name \\nfor an unraveled hypercube, a tesseract, which found its way into the \\nEnglish language. \\n\\nHinton\\'s cubes were widely advertised in women\\'s magazines and \\nwere even used in seances, where they soon became objects of mystical \\nimportance. By mediating on Hinton\\'s cubes, it was claimed by members \\nof high society, you could catch glimpses of the fourth dimension and \\nhence the nether world of ghosts and the dearly departed. His disciples \\nspent hours contemplating and meditating on these cubes, until they \\nattained the ability to mentally rearrange and reassemble these cubes \\nvia the fourth dimension into a hypercube. Those who could perform \\nthis mental feat, it was said, would attain the highest state of nirvana. \\n\\nAs an analogy, take a three-dimensional cube. Although a Flatlander \\ncannot visualize a cube in its entirety, it is possible for us to unravel the \\ncube in three dimensions, so that we have a series of six squares making \\na cross. Of course, a Flatlander cannot reassemble the squares to make \\na cube. In the second dimension, the joints between each square are \\nrigid and cannot be moved. However, these joints are easy to bend in \\nthe third dimension. A Flatlander witnessing this event would see the \\nsquares disappear, leaving only one square in his universe (Figure 3.6). \\n\\nLikewise, a hypercube in four dimensions cannot be visualized. But \\none can unravel a hypercube into its lower components, which are ordi- \\nnary three-dimensional cubes. These cubes, in turn, can be arranged in \\na three-dimensional cross \\xe2\\x80\\x94 a tesseract. It is impossible for us to visualize \\nhow to wrap up these cubes to form a hypercube. However, a higher- \\ndimensional person can \"lift\" each cube off our universe and then wrap \\nup the cube to form a hypercube. (Our three-dimensional eyes, wit- \\nnessing this spectacular event, would only see the other cubes disappear, \\nleaving only one cube in our universe.) So pervasive was Hinton\\'s influ- \\nence that Salvadore Dali used Hinton\\'s tesseract in his famous painting \\nChristus Hypercubus, on display at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in \\nNew York, which depicts Christ being crucified on a four-dimensional \\ncross (Figure 3.7). \\n\\nHinton also knew of a second way to visualize higher-dimensional \\nobjects: by looking at the shadows they cast in lower dimensions. For \\nexample, a Flatlander can visualize a cube by looking at its two-dimen- \\nsional shadow. A cube looks like two squares joined together. Similarly, \\na hypercube\\'s shadow cast on the third dimension becomes a cube \\nwithin a cube (Figure 3.8). \\n\\nIn addition to visualizing unravelings of hypercubes and examining \\ntheir shadows, Hinton was aware of a third way to conceptualize the \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n? \\n\\n\\nFigure 3.6. Flatlanders cannot visualize a cube, but they can conceptualize a \\nthree-dimensional cube by unraveling it. To a Flatlander, a cube, when unfolded, \\nresembles a cross, consisting of six squares. Similarly, we cannot visualize a four- \\ndimensional hypercube, but if we unfold it we have a series of cubes arranged in \\na crosslike tesseract. Although the cubes of a tesseract appear immobile, a four- \\ndimensional person can \"wrap up\" the cubes into a hypercube. \\n\\n\\n71 \\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 3.7. In Christus 1 1 y perc u bus . Salvador Dali depicted Christ as being \\ncrucified on a tesseract, an unraveled hypercube. ( The Metropolitan Museum of \\nArt. Gift of Chester Dale, Collection, 1955. \\xc2\\xa9 1993. Ars, New York/Demart Pro \\nArte, Geneva) \\n\\n\\n72 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 3.8. A Flatlander can visualize a cube by examining its shadow, which \\nappears as a square within a square. If the cube is rotated, the squares execute \\nmotions that appear impossible to a Flatlander. Similarly, the shadow of a hyper- \\ncube is a cube within a cube. If the hypercube is rotated in four dimensions, the \\ncubes execute motions that appear impossible to our three-dimensional brains. \\n\\n\\n73 \\n\\n\\n\\n74 \\n\\n\\nENTERING THE FIFTH DIMENSION \\n\\n\\nfourth dimension: by cross sections. For example, when Mr. Square is \\nsent into the third dimension, his eyes can see only two-dimensional \\ncross sections of the third dimension. Thus he can see only circles \\nappear, get larger, change color, and then suddenly disappear. If Mr. \\nSquare moved past an apple, he would see a red circle materialize out \\nof nowhere, gradually expand, then contract, then turn into a small \\nbrown circle (the stem), and finally disappear. Likewise, Hinton knew \\nthat if we were hurled into the fourth dimension, we would see strange \\nobjects suddenly appear out of nowhere, get larger, change color, \\nchange shape, get smaller, and finally disappear. \\n\\nIn summary, Hinton\\'s contribution may be his popularization of \\nhigher-dimensional figures using three methods: by examining their \\nshadows, their cross sections, and their unravellings. Even today, these \\nthree methods are the chief ways in which professional mathematicians \\nand physicists conceptualize higher-dimensional objects in their work. \\nThe scientists whose diagrams appear in today\\'s physics journals owe a \\nsmall debt of gratitude to Hinton\\'s work. \\n\\n\\nThe Contest on the Fourth Dimension \\n\\nIn his articles, Hinton had answers for all possible questions. When peo- \\nple asked him to name the fourth dimension, he would reply that the \\nwords ana and kata described moving in the fourth dimension and were \\nthe counterparts of the terms up and down, or left and right. When asked \\nwhere the fourth dimension was, he also had a ready answer. \\n\\nFor the moment, consider the motion of cigarette smoke in a closed \\nroom. Because the atoms of the smoke, by the laws of thermodynamics, \\nspread and diffuse into all possible locations in the room, we can deter- \\nmine if there are any regions of ordinary three-dimensional space that \\nthe smoke molecules miss. However, experimental observations show \\nthat there are no such hidden regions. Therefore, the fourth spatial \\ndimension is possible only if it is smaller than the smoke particles. Thus \\nif the fourth dimension actually exists, it must be incredibly small, even \\nsmaller than an atom. This is the philosophy that Hinton adopted, that \\nall objects in our three-dimensional universe exist in the fourth dimen- \\nsion, but that the fourth dimension is so small that it evades any exper- \\nimental observation. (We will find that physicists today adopt essentially \\nthe same philosophy as Hinton and conclude that the higher dimensions \\nare too small to be experimentally seen. When asked, \"What is light?\" \\nhe also had a ready answer. Following Riemann, Hinton believed that \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Man Who \"Saw\" the Fourth Dimension \\n\\n\\n75 \\n\\n\\nlight is a vibration of the unseen fourth dimension, which is essentially \\nthe viewpoint taken today by many theoretical physicists.) \\n\\nIn the United States, Hinton single-handedly sparked an enormous \\npublic interest in the fourth dimension. Popular magazines like Harper\\'s \\nWeekly, McClure\\xe2\\x80\\x99s, Current Literature, Popular Science Monthly, and Science all \\ndevoted pages to the blossoming interest in the fourth dimension. But \\nwhat probably ensured Hinton\\'s fame in America was the famous contest \\nsponsored by Scientific American in 1909. This unusual contest offered a \\n$500 prize (a considerable amount of money in 1909) to \"the best pop- \\nular explanation of the Fourth Dimension.\" The magazine\\'s editors \\nwere pleasantly surprised by the deluge of letters that poured into their \\noffices, including entries from as far away as Turkey. Austria, Holland, \\nIndia, Australia. France, and Germany. \\n\\nThe object of the contest was to \"set forth in an essay not longer \\nthan twenty-five hundred words the meaning of the term so that the \\nordinary lay reader could understand it.\" It drew a large number of \\nserious essays. Some lamented the fact that people like Zollner and Slade \\nhad besmirched the reputation of the fourth dimension by confusing it \\nwith spiritualism. However, many of the essays recognized Hinton\\'s pio- \\nneering work on the fourth dimension. (Surprisingly, not one essay men- \\ntioned the work of Einstein. In 1909, it was still far from clear that Ein- \\nstein had uncovered the secret of space and time. In fact, the idea of \\ntime as the fourth dimension did not appear in a single essay.) \\n\\nWithout experimental verification, the Scientific American contest \\ncould not, of course, resolve the question of the existence of higher \\ndimensions. However, the contest did address the question of what \\nhigher-dimensional objects might look like. \\n\\n\\nMonsters from the Fourth Dimension \\n\\nWhat would it be like to meet a creature from a higher dimension? \\n\\nPerhaps the best way to explain the wonder and excitement of a \\nhypothetical visit to other dimensions is through science fiction, where \\nwriters have tried to grapple with this question. \\n\\nIn \"The Monster from Nowhere,\" writer Nelson Bond tried to imag- \\nine what would happen if an explorer in the jungles of Latin America \\nencountered a beast from a higher dimension. \\n\\nOur hero is Burch Patterson, adventurer, bon vivant, and soldier of \\nfortune, who hits on the idea of capturing wild animals in the towering \\nmountains of Peru. The expedition will be paid for by various zoos. \\n\\n\\n\\n76 \\n\\n\\nENTERING THE FIFTH DIMENSION \\n\\n\\nwhich put up the money for the trip in return for whatever animals \\nPatterson can find. With much hoopla and fanfare, the press covers the \\nprogress of the expedition as itjourneys into unexplored territory. But \\nafter a few weeks, the expedition loses contact with the outside world \\nand mysteriously disappears without a trace. After a long and futile \\nsearch, the authorities reluctantly give the explorers up for dead. \\n\\nTwo years later, Burch Patterson abruptly reappears. He meets \\nsecretly with reporters and tells them an astonishing story of tragedy and \\nheroism. Just before the expedition disappeared, it encountered a fan- \\ntastic animal in the Maratan Plateau of upper Peru, an unearthly bloblike \\ncreature that was constantly changing shape in the most bizarre fashion. \\nThese black blobs hovered in midair, disappearing and reappearing and \\nchanging shape and size. The blobs then unexpectedly attacked the \\nexpedition, killing most of the men. The blobs hoisted some of the \\nremaining men off the ground; they screamed and then disappeared \\ninto thin air. \\n\\nOnly Burch escaped the rout. Dazed and frightened, he nonetheless \\nstudied these blobs from a distance and gradually formed a theory about \\nwhat they were and how to capture them. He had read Flatland years \\nbefore, and imagined that anyone sticking his fingers into and out of \\nFlatland would startle the two-dimensional inhabitants. The Flatlanders \\nwould see pulsating rings of flesh hovering in midair (our fingers poking \\nthrough Flatland), constantly changing size. Likewise, reasoned Patter- \\nson, any higher-dimensional creature sticking his foot or arms through \\nour universe would appear as three-dimensional, pulsating blobs of \\nflesh, appearing out of nowhere and constantly changing shape and size. \\nThat would also explain why his team members had disappeared into \\nthin air: They had been dragged into a higher-dimensional universe. \\n\\nBut one question still plagued him: How do you capture a higher- \\ndimensional being? If a Flatlander, seeing our finger poke its way \\nthrough his two-dimensional universe, tried to capture our finger, he \\nwould be at a loss. If he tried to lasso our finger, we could simply remove \\nour finger and disappear. Similarly, Patterson reasoned, he could put a \\nnet around one of these blobs, but then the higher-dimensional creature \\ncould simply pull his \"finger\" or \"leg\" out of our universe, and the net \\nwould collapse. \\n\\nSuddenly, the answer came to him: If a Flatlander were to try to \\ncapture our finger as it poked its way into Flatland, the Flatlander could \\nstick a needle through our finger, painfully impaling it to the two-dimen- \\nsional universe. Thus Patterson\\'s strategy was to drive a spike through \\none of the blobs and impale the creature in our universe! \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Man Who \"Saw\" the Fourth Dimension \\n\\n\\n77 \\n\\n\\nAfter months of observing the creature, Patterson identified what \\nlooked like the creature\\'s \"foot\" and drove a spike right through it. It \\ntook him 2 years to capture the creature and ship the writhing, strug- \\ngling blob back to New Jersey. \\n\\nFinally, Patterson announces a major press conference where he will \\nunveil a fantastic creature caught in Peru. Journalists and scientists alike \\ngasp in horror when the creature is unveiled, writhing and struggling \\nagainst a large steel rod. Like a scene from King Kong, one newspaper- \\nman. against the rules, takes flash pictures of the creature. The flash \\nenrages the creature, which then struggles so hard against the rod that \\nits flesh begins to tear. Suddenly, the monster is free, and pandemonium \\nbreaks out. People are torn to shreds, and Patterson and others are \\ngrabbed by the creature and then disappear into the fourth dimension. \\n\\nIn the aftermath of the tragedy, one of the survivors of the massacre \\ndecides to burn all evidence of the creature. Better to leave this mystery \\nforever unsolved. \\n\\n\\nBuilding a Four-Dimensional House \\n\\nIn the previous section, the question of what happens when we encoun- \\nter a higher-dimensional being was explored. But what happens in the \\nreverse situation, when we visit a higher-dimensional universe? As we \\nhave seen, a Flatlander cannot possibly visualize a three-dimensional uni- \\nverse in its entirety. However, there are, as Hinton showed, several ways \\nin which the Flatlander can comprehend revealing fragments of higher- \\ndimensional universes. \\n\\nIn his classic short story \"... And He Built a Crooked House \\nRobert Heinlein explored the many possibilities of living in an unraveled \\nhypercube. \\n\\nQuintus Teal is a brash, flamboyant architect whose ambition is to \\nbuild a house in a truly revolutionary shape: a tesseract, a hypercube \\nthat has been unraveled in the third dimension. He cons his friends Mr. \\nand Mrs. Bailey into buying the house. \\n\\nBuilt in Los Angeles, the tesseract is a series of eight ultramodern \\ncubes stacked on top of one another in the shape of a cross. Unfortu- \\nnately, just as Teal is about to show off his new creation to the Baileys, \\nan earthquake strikes southern California, and the house collapses into \\nitself. The cubes begin to topple, but strangely only a single cube is left \\nstanding. The other cubes have mysteriously disappeared. When Teal \\nand the Baileys cautiously enter the house, nowjust a single cube, they \\n\\n\\n\\n78 \\n\\n\\nENTERING THE FIFTH DIMENSION \\n\\n\\nare amazed that the other missing rooms are clearly visible through the \\nwindows of the first floor. But that is impossible. The house is now only \\na single cube. How can the interior of a single cube be connected to a \\nseries of other cubes that cannot be seen from the outside? \\n\\nThey climb the stairs and find the master bedroom above the entry- \\nway. Instead of finding the third floor, however, they find themselves \\nback on the ground floor. Thinking the house is haunted, the frightened \\nBaileys race to the front door. Instead ofleading to the outside, the front \\ndoorjust leads to another room. Mrs. Bailey faints. \\n\\nAs they explore the house, they find that each room is connected to \\nan impossible series of other rooms. In the original house, each cube \\nhad windows to view the outside. Now, all windows face other rooms. \\nThere is no outside! \\n\\nScared out of their wits, they slowly try all the doors of the house, \\nonly to wind up in other rooms. Finally, in the study they decide to open \\nthe four Venetian blinds and look outside. When they open the first \\nVenetian blind, they find that they are peering down at the Empire State \\nBuilding. Apparently, that window opened up to a \"window\" in space \\njust above the spire of the tower. When they open the second Venetian \\nblind, they find themselves staring at a vast ocean, except it is upside \\ndown. Opening the third Venetian blind, they find themselves looking \\nat Nothing. Not empty space. Not inky blackness. Just Nothing. Finally, \\nopening up the last Venetian blind, they find themselves gazing at a \\nbleak desert landscape, probably a scene from Mars. \\n\\nAfter a harrowing tour through the rooms of the house, with each \\nroom impossibly connected to the other rooms. Teal finally figures it all \\nout. The earthquake, he reasons, must have collapsed the joints of var- \\nious cubes and folded the house in the fourth dimension. \\n\\nOn the outside. Teal\\'s house originally looked like an ordinary \\nsequence of cubes. The house did not collapse because the joints \\nbetween the cubes were rigid and stable in three dimensions. However, \\nviewed from the fourth dimension. Teal\\'s house is an unraveled hyper- \\ncube that can be reassembled or folded back into a hypercube. Thus \\nwhen the house was shaken by the earthquake, it somehow folded up in \\nfour dimensions, leaving only a single cube dangling in our third dimen- \\nsion. Anyone walking into the single remaining cube would view a series \\nof rooms connected in a seemingly impossible fashion. By racing \\nthrough the various rooms. Teal has moved through the fourth dimen- \\nsion without noticing it. \\n\\nAlthough our protagonists seem doomed to spend their lives fruit- \\nlessly wandering in circles inside a hypercube, another violent earth- \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Man Who \"Saw\" the Fourth Dimension \\n\\n\\n79 \\n\\n\\nquake shakes the tesseract. Holding their breath, Teal and the terrified \\nBaileys leap out the nearest window. When they land, they find them- \\nselves in Joshua Tree National Monument, miles from Los Angeles. \\nHours later, hitching a ride back to the city, they return to the house, \\nonly to find that the last remaining cube has vanished. Where did the \\ntesseract go? It is probably drifting somewhere in the fourth dimension. \\n\\n\\nThe Useless Fourth Dimension \\n\\nIn retrospect, Riemann\\'s famous lecture was popularized to a wide audi- \\nence via mystics, philosophers, and artists, but did little to further our \\nunderstanding of nature. From the perspective of modern physics, we \\ncan also see why the years 1860 to 1905 did not produce any fundamental \\nbreakthroughs in our understanding of hyperspace. \\n\\nFirst, there was no attempt to use hyperspace to simplify the laws of \\nnature. Without Riemann\\'s original guiding principle \\xe2\\x80\\x94 that the laws of \\nnature become simple in higher dimensions \\xe2\\x80\\x94 scientists during this \\nperiod were groping in the dark. Riemann\\'s seminal idea ofusing geom- \\netry \\xe2\\x80\\x94 that is, crumpled hyperspace \\xe2\\x80\\x94 to explain the essence of a \"force\" \\nwas forgotten during those years. \\n\\nSecond, there was no attempt to exploit Faraday\\'s field concept or \\nRiemann\\'s metric tensor to find the field equations obeyed by hyper- \\nspace. The mathematical apparatus developed by Riemann became a \\nprovince of pure mathematics, contrary to Riemann\\'s original inten- \\ntions. Without field theory, you cannot make any predictions with hyper- \\nspace. \\n\\nThus by the turn of the century, the cynics claimed (with justifica- \\ntion) that there was no experimental confirmation of the fourth dimen- \\nsion. Worse, they claimed, there was no physical motivation for intro- \\nducing the fourth dimension, other than to titillate the general public \\nwith ghost stories. This deplorable situation would soon change, how- \\never. Within a few decades, the theory of the fourth dimension (of time) \\nwould forever change the course of human history. It would give us the \\natomic bomb and the theory of Creation itself. And the man who would \\ndo it would be an obscure physicist named Albert Einstein. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n4 \\n\\nThe Secret of Light: \\n\\nVibrations in \\nthe Fifth Dimension \\n\\n\\nIf [relativity] should prove to be correct, as I expect it will, he \\nwill be considered the Copernicus of the twentieth century. \\n\\nMax Planck on Albert Einstein \\n\\n\\nT HE life of Albert Einstein appeared to be one long series offailures \\nand disappointments. Even his mother was distressed at how slowly \\nhe learned to talk. His elementary-school teachers thought him a foolish \\ndreamer. They complained that he was constantly disrupting classroom \\ndiscipline with his silly questions. One teacher even told the boy bluntly \\nthat he would prefer that Einstein drop out of his class. \\n\\nHe had few friends in school. Losing interest in his courses, he \\ndropped out of high school. Without a high-school diploma, he had to \\ntake special exams to enter college, but he did not pass them and had \\nto take them a second time. He even failed the exam for the Swiss mil- \\nitary because he had flat feet. \\n\\nAfter graduation, he could not get a job. He was an unemployed \\nphysicist who was passed over for a teaching position at the university \\nand was rejected for jobs everywhere he applied. He earned barely 3 \\nfrancs an hour \\xe2\\x80\\x94 a pittance \\xe2\\x80\\x94 by tutoring students. He told his friend \\nMaurice Solovine that \"an easier way of earning a living would be to \\nplay the violin in public places.\" \\n\\n\\n80 \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Secret of Light: Vibrations in the Fifth Dimension \\n\\n\\n81 \\n\\n\\nEinstein was a man who rejected the things most men chase after, \\nsuch as power and money. However, he once noted pessimistically, \"By \\nthe mere existence of his stomach, everyone is condemned to participate \\nin that chase.\" Finally, through the influence of a friend, he landed a \\nlowly job as a clerk at the Swiss patent office in Bern, earning just enough \\nmoney so his parents would not have to support him. On his meager \\nsalary, he supported his young wife and their newborn baby. \\n\\nLacking financial resources or connections with the scientific estab- \\nlishment, Einstein began to work in solitude at the patent office. In \\nbetween patent applications, his mind drifted to problems that had \\nintrigued him as a youth. He then undertook a task that would eventually \\nchange the course of human history. His tool was the fourth \\ndimension. \\n\\n\\nChildren\\'s Questions \\n\\nWherein lies the essence of Einstein\\'s genius? In The Ascent of Man, Jacob \\nBronowski wrote: \"The genius of men like Newton and Einstein lies in \\nthat: they ask transparent, innocent questions which turn out to have \\ncatastrophic answers. Einstein was a man who could ask immensely sim- \\nple questions.\" 1 As a child, Einstein asked himself the simple question: \\nWhat would a light beam look like if you could catch up with one? Would \\nyou see a stationary wave, frozen in time? This question set him on a 50- \\nyearjourney through the mysteries of space and time. \\n\\nImagine trying to overtake a train in a speeding car. If we hit the gas \\npedal, our car races neck-and-neck with the train. We can peer inside \\nthe train, which now appears to be at rest. We can see the seats and the \\npeople, who are acting as though the train weren\\'t moving. Similarly, \\nEinstein as a child imagined traveling alongside a light beam. \\nHe thought that the light beam should resemble a series of \\nstationary waves, frozen in time; that is, the light beam should appear \\nmotionless. \\n\\nWhen Einstein was 16 years old, he spotted the flaw in this argument. \\nHe recalled later, \\n\\n\\nAfter ten years of reflection such a principle resulted from a paradox upon \\nwhich I had already hit at the age of sixteen: If I pursue a beam of light \\nwith the velocity c (velocity of light in a vacuum) I should observe such a \\nbeam of light as a spatially oscillatory electromagnetic field at rest. How- \\n\\n\\n\\n82 \\n\\n\\nENTERING THE FIFTH DIMENSION \\n\\n\\never, there seems to be no such thing, whether on the basis of experience \\nor according to Maxwell\\'s equations . 2 \\n\\nIn college, Einstein confirmed his suspicions. He learned that light \\ncan be expressed in terms of Faraday\\'s electric and magnetic fields, and \\nthat these fields obey the field equations found by James Clerk Maxwell. \\nAs he suspected, he found that stationary, frozen waves are not allowed \\nby Maxwell\\'s field equations. In fact, Einstein showed that a light beam \\ntravels at the same velocity c, no matter how hard you try to catch \\nup with it. \\n\\nAt first, this seemed absurd. This meant that we could never overtake \\nthe train (light beam). Worse, no matter how fast we drove our car. the \\ntrain would always seem to be traveling ahead of us at the same velocity. \\nIn other words, a light beam is like the \"ghost ship\" that old sailors love \\nto spin tall tales about. It is a phantom vessel that can never be caught. \\nNo matter how fast we sail, the ghost ship always eludes us, taunting us. \\n\\nIn 1905, with plenty of time on his hands at the patent office, Einstein \\ncarefully analyzed the field equations of Maxwell and was led to postulate \\nthe principle of special relativity: The speed of light is the same in all \\nconstantly moving frames. This innocent-sounding principle is one of \\nthe greatest achievements of the human spirit. Some have said that it \\nranks with Newton\\'s law of gravitation as one of the greatest scientific \\ncreations of the human mind in the 2 million years our species has been \\nevolving on this planet. From it, we can logically unlock the secret of the \\nvast energies released by the stars and galaxies. \\n\\nTo see how this simple statement can lead to such profound conclu- \\nsions, let us return to the analogy of the car trying to overtake the train. \\nLet us say that a pedestrian on the sidewalk clocks our car traveling at \\n\\n99 miles per hour, and the train traveling at 100 miles per hour. Natu- \\nrally, from our point of view in the car, we see the train moving ahead \\nof us at 1 mile per hour. This is because velocities can be added and \\nsubtracted, just like ordinary numbers. \\n\\nNow let us replace the train by a light beam, but keep the velocity of \\nlight atjust 100 miles per hour. The pedestrian still clocks our car trav- \\neling at 99 miles per hour in hot pursuit of the light beam traveling at \\n\\n100 miles per hour. According to the pedestrian, we should be closing \\nin on the light beam. However, according to relativity, we in the car \\nactually see the light beam not traveling ahead of us at 1 mile per hour, \\nas expected, but speeding ahead of us at 100 miles per hour. Remark- \\nably, we see the light beam racing ahead of us as though we were at rest. \\nNot believing our own eyes, we slam on the gas pedal until the pedestrian \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Secret of Light: Vibrations in the Fifth Dimension \\n\\n\\n83 \\n\\n\\nclocks our car racing ahead at 99.99999 miles per hour. Surely, we think, \\nwe must be about to overtake the light beam. However, when we look \\nout the window, we see the light beam still speeding ahead of us at 100 \\nmiles per hour. \\n\\nUneasily, we reach several bizarre, disturbing conclusions. First, no \\nmatter how much we gun the engines of our car, the pedestrian tells us \\nthat we can approach but never exceed 100 miles per hour. This seems \\nto be the top velocity of the car. Second, no matter how close we come \\nto 100 miles per hour, we still see the light beam speeding ahead of us \\nat 100 miles per hour, as though we weren\\'t moving at all. \\n\\nBut this is absurd. How can both people in the speeding car and the \\nstationary person measure the velocity of the light beam to be the same? \\nOrdinarily, this is impossible. It appears to be nature\\'s colossal joke. \\n\\nThere is only one way out of this paradox. Inexorably, we are led to \\nthe astonishing conclusion that shook Einstein to the core when he first \\nconceived of it. The only solution to this puzzle is that time slows down \\nfor us in the car. If the pedestrian takes a telescope and peers into our \\ncar, he sees everyone in the car moving exceptionally slowly. However, \\nwe in the car never notice that time is slowing down because our brains, \\ntoo, have slowed down, and everything seems normal to us. Further- \\nmore, he sees that the car has become flattened in the direction of \\nmotion. The car has shrunk like an accordion. However, we never feel \\nthis effect because our bodies, too, have shrunk. \\n\\nSpace and time play tricks on us. In actual experiments, scientists \\nhave shown that the speed of light is always c, no matter how fast we \\ntravel. This is because the faster we travel, the slower our clocks tick and \\nthe shorter our rulers become. In fact, our clocks slow down and our \\nrulers shrinkjust enough so that whenever we measure the speed of \\nlight, it comes out the same. \\n\\nBut why can\\'t we see or feel this effect? Since our brains are thinking \\nmore slowly, and our bodies are also getting thinner as we approach the \\nspeed of light, we are blissfully unaware that we are turning into slow- \\nwitted pancakes. \\n\\nThese relativistic effects, of course, are too small to be seen in every- \\nday life because the speed of light is so great. Being a New Yorker, how- \\never, I am constantly reminded of these fantastic distortions of space \\nand time whenever I ride the subway. When I am on the subway platform \\nwith nothing to do except wait for the next subway train, I sometimes \\nlet my imagination drift and wonder what it would be like if the speed \\nof light were only, say, 30 miles per hour, the speed of a subway train. \\nThen when the train finally roars into the station, it appears squashed, \\n\\n\\n\\n84 \\n\\n\\nENTERING THE FIFTH DIMENSION \\n\\n\\nlike an accordion. The train, I imagine, would be a flattened slab of \\nmetal 1 foot thick, barreling down the tracks. And everyone inside the \\nsubway cars would be as thin as paper. They would also be virtually frozen \\nin time, as though they were motionless statues. However, as the train \\ncomes to a grinding halt, it suddenly expands, until this slab of metal \\ngradually fills the entire station. \\n\\nAs absurd as these distortions might appear, the passengers inside \\nthe train would be totally oblivious to these changes. Their bodies and \\nspace itself would be compressed along the direction of motion of the \\ntrain; everything would appear to have its normal shape. Furthermore, \\ntheir brains would have slowed down, so that everyone inside the train \\nwould act normally. Then when the subway train finally comes to a halt, \\nthey are totally unaware that their train, to someone on the platform, \\nappears to miraculously expand until it fills up the entire platform. \\nWhen the passengers depart from the train, they are totally oblivious to \\nthe profound changes demanded by special relativity.* \\n\\n\\nThe Fourth Dimension and High-School Reunions \\n\\nThere have been, of course, hundreds of popular accounts of Einstein\\'s \\ntheory, stressing different aspects of his work. However, few accounts \\ncapture the essence behind the theory of special relativity, which is that \\ntime is the fourth dimension and that the laws of nature are simplified \\nand unified in higher dimensions. Introducing time as the fourth dimen- \\nsion overthrew the concept of time dating all the way back to Aristotle. \\nSpace and time would now be forever dialectically linked by special rel- \\nativity. (Zollner and Hinton had assumed that the next dimension to be \\ndiscovered would be the fourth spatial dimension. In this respect, they \\nwere wrong and H. G. Wells was correct. The next dimension to be \\ndiscovered would be time, a fourth temporal dimension. Progress in \\nunderstanding the fourth spatial dimension would have to wait several \\nmore decades.) \\n\\nTo see how higher dimensions simplify the laws of nature, we recall \\nthat any object has length, width, and depth. Since we have the freedom \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2Similarly, passengers riding in the train would think that the train was at rest and that \\nthe subway station was coming toward the train. They would see the platform and everyone \\nstanding on it compressed like an accordian. Then this leads us to a contradiction, that \\npeople on the train and in the station each think that the other has been compressed. The \\nresolution of this paradox is a bit delicate. 1 \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Secret of Light: Vibrations in the Fifth Dimension \\n\\n\\n85 \\n\\n\\nto rotate an object by 90 degrees, we can turn its length into width and \\nits width into depth. By a simple rotation, we can interchange any of the \\nthree spatial dimensions. Now if time is the fourth dimension, then it is \\npossible to make \"rotations\" that convert space into time and vice versa. \\nThese four-dimensional \"rotations\" are precisely the distortions of \\nspace and time demanded by special relativity. In other words, space and \\ntime have mixed in an essential way, governed by relativity. The meaning \\nof time as being the fourth dimension is that time and space can rotate \\ninto each other in a mathematically precise way. From now on. they must \\nbe treated as two aspects of the same quantity: space-time. Thus adding \\na higher dimension helped to unify the laws of nature. \\n\\nNewton, writing 300 years ago, thought that time beat at the same \\nrate everywhere in the universe. Whether we sat on the earth, on Mars, \\nor on a distant star, clocks were expected to tick at the same rate. There \\nwas thought to be an absolute, uniform rhythm to the passage of time \\nthroughout the entire universe. Rotations between time and space were \\ninconceivable. Time and space were two distinct quantities with no rela- \\ntionship between them. Unifying them into a single quantity was \\nunthinkable. However, according to special relativity, time can beat at \\ndifferent rates, depending on how fast one is moving. Time being the \\nfourth dimension means that time is intrinsically linked with movement \\nin space. How fast a clock ticks depends on how fast it is moving in space. \\nElaborate experiments done with atomic clocks sent into orbit around \\nthe earth have confirmed that a clock on the earth and a clock rocketing \\nin outer space tick at different rates. \\n\\nI was graphically reminded of the relativity principle when I was \\ninvited to my twentieth high-school reunion. Although I hadn\\'t seen \\nmost of my classmates since graduation, I assumed that all of them would \\nshow the same telltale signs of aging. As expected, most of us at the \\nreunion were relieved to find that the aging process was universal: It \\nseemed that all of us sported graying temples, expanding waistlines, and \\na few wrinkles. Although we were separated across space and time by \\nseveral thousand miles and 20 years, each of us had assumed that time \\nhad beat uniformly for all. We automatically assumed that each of us \\nwould age at the same rate. \\n\\nThen my mind wandered, and I imagined what would happen if a \\nclassmate walked into the reunion hall looking exactly as he had on grad- \\nuation day. At first, he would probably draw stares from his classmates. \\nWas this the same person we knew 20 years ago? When people realized \\nthat he was, a panic would surge through the hall. \\n\\n\\n\\n86 \\n\\n\\nENTERING THE FIFTH DIMENSION \\n\\n\\nWe would bejolted by this encounter because we tacitly assume that \\nclocks beat the same everywhere, even if they are separated by vast dis- \\ntances. However, if time is the fourth dimension, then space and time \\ncan rotate into each other and clocks can beat at different rates, depend- \\ning on how fast they move. This classmate, for example, may have \\nentered a rocket traveling at near-light speeds. For us, the rocket trip \\nmay have lasted for 20 years. However, for him, because time slowed \\ndown in the speeding rocket, he aged only a few moments from grad- \\nuation day. To him, he just entered the rocket, sped into outer space \\nfor a few minutes, and then landed back on earth in time for his twen- \\ntieth high-school reunion after a short, pleasant journey, still looking \\nyouthful amid a field of graying hair. \\n\\nI am also reminded that the fourth dimension simplifies the laws of \\nnature whenever I think back to my first encounter with Maxwell\\'s field \\nequations. Every undergraduate student learning the theory of electric- \\nity and magnetism toils for several years to master these eight abstract \\nequations, which are exceptionally ugly and very opaque. Maxwell\\'s \\neight equations are clumsy and difficult to memorize because time and \\nspace are treated separately. (To this day, I have to look them up in a \\nbook to make sure that I get all the signs and symbols correct.) I still \\nremember the relief I felt when I learned that these equations collapse \\ninto one trivial-looking equation when time is treated as the fourth \\ndimension. In one masterful stroke, the fourth dimension simplifies \\nthese equations in a beautiful, transparent fashion. 4 Written in this way, \\nthe equations possess a higher symmetry; that is, space and time can turn \\ninto each other. Like a beautiful snowflake that remains the same when \\nwe rotate it around its axis, Maxwell\\'s field equations, written in relativ- \\nistic form, remain the same when we rotate space into time. \\n\\nRemarkably, this one simple equation, written in a relativistic fashion, \\ncontains the same physical content as the eight equations originally writ- \\nten down by Maxwell over 100 years ago. This one equation, in turn, \\ngoverns the properties of dynamos, radar, radio, television, lasers, house- \\nhold appliances, and the cornucopia of consumer electronics that \\nappear in everyone\\'s living room. This was one of my first exposures to \\nthe concept of beauty in physics \\xe2\\x80\\x94 that is, that the symmetry of four- \\ndimensional space can explain a vast ocean of physical knowledge that \\nwould fill an engineering library. \\n\\nOnce again, this demonstrates one of the main themes of this book, \\nthat the addition of higher dimensions helps to simplify and unify the \\nlaws of nature. \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Secret of Light: Vibrations in the Fifth Dimension \\n\\n\\n87 \\n\\n\\nMatter as Condensed Energy \\n\\nThis discussion of unifying the laws of nature, so far, has been rather \\nabstract, and would have remained so had Einstein not taken the next \\nfateful step. He realized that if space and time can be unified into a \\nsingle entity, called space-time, then perhaps matter and energy can \\nalso be united into a dialectical relationship. If rulers can shrink and \\nclocks slow down, he reasoned, then everything that we measure with \\nrulers and clocks must also change. However, almost everything in a \\nphysicist\\'s laboratory is measured by rulers and clocks. This meant that \\nphysicists had to recalibrate all the laboratory quantities they once took \\nfor granted to be constant. \\n\\nSpecifically, energy is a quantity that depends on how we measure \\ndistances and time intervals. A speeding test car slamming into a brick \\nwall obviously has energy. If the speeding car approaches the speed of \\nlight, however, its properties become distorted. It shrinks like an accor- \\ndion and clocks in it slow down. \\n\\nMore important, Einstein found that the mass of the car also \\nincreases as it speeds up. But where did this excess mass come from? \\nEinstein concluded that it came from the energy. \\n\\nThis had disturbing consequences. Two of the great discoveries of \\nnineteenth-century physics were the conservation of mass and the con- \\nservation of energy; that is, the total mass and total energy of a closed \\nsystem, taken separately, do not change. For example, if the speeding \\ncar hits the brick wall, the energy of the car does not vanish, but is \\nconverted into the sound energy of the crash, the kinetic energy of the \\nflying brick fragments, heat energy, and so on. The total energy (and \\ntotal mass) before and after the crash is the same. \\n\\nHowever, Einstein now said that the energy of the car could be con- \\nverted into mass \\xe2\\x80\\x94 a new conservation principle that said that the sum \\ntotal of the mass added to energy must always remain the same. Matter \\ndoes not suddenly disappear, nor does energy spring out of nothing. In \\nthis regard, the God-builders were wrong and Lenin was right. Matter \\ndisappears only to unleash enormous quantities of energy, or vice versa. \\n\\nWhen Einstein was 26 years old, he calculated precisely how energy \\nmust change if the relativity principle was correct, and he discovered the \\nrelation E = mc\\\\ Since the speed of light squared (c 1 ) is an astronomi- \\ncally large number, a small amount of matter can release a vast amount \\nof energy. Locked within the smallest particles of matter is a storehouse \\nof energy, more than 1 million times the energy released in a chemical \\n\\n\\n\\n88 \\n\\n\\nENTERING THE FIFTH DIMENSION \\n\\n\\nexplosion. Matter, in some sense, can be seen as an almost inexhaustible \\nstorehouse of energy; that is, matter is condensed energy. \\n\\nIn this respect, we see the profound difference between the work of \\nthe mathematician (Charles Hinton) and that of the physicist (Albert \\nEinstein). Hinton spent most of his adult years trying to visualize higher \\nspatial dimensions. He had no interest in finding a physical interpreta- \\ntion for the fourth dimension. Einstein saw, however, that the fourth \\ndimension can be taken as a temporal one. He was guided by a conviction \\nand physical intuition that higher dimensions have a purpose: to unify \\nthe principles of nature. By adding higher dimensions, he could unite \\nphysical concepts that, in a three-dimensional world, have no connec- \\ntion, such as matter and energy. \\n\\nFrom then on, the concept of matter and energy would be taken as \\na single unit: matter-energy. The direct impact of Einstein\\'s work on \\nthe fourth dimension was, of course, the hydrogen bomb, which has \\nproved to be the most powerful creation of twentieth-century science. \\n\\n\\n\"The Happiest Thought of My Life\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\n\\nEinstein, however, wasn\\'t satisfied. His special theory of relativity alone \\nwould have guaranteed him a place among the giants of physics. But \\nthere was something missing. \\n\\nEinstein\\'s key insight was to use the fourth dimension to unite the \\nlaws ofnature by introducing two new concepts: space-time and matter- \\nenergy. Although he had unlocked some of the deepest secrets of \\nnature, he realized there were several gaping holes in his theory. What \\nwas the relationship between these two new concepts? More specifically, \\nwhat about accelerations, which are ignored in special relativity? And \\nwhat about gravitation? \\n\\nHis friend Max Planck, the founder of the quantum theory, advised \\nthe young Einstein that the problem of gravitation was too difficult. \\nPlanck told him that he was too ambitious: \"As an older friend I must \\nadvise you against it for in the first place you will not succeed; and even \\nif you succeed, no one will believe you .\" 5 Einstein, however, plunged \\nahead to unravel the mystery of gravitation. Once again, the key to his \\nmomentous discovery was to ask questions that only children ask. \\n\\nWhen children ride in an elevator, they sometimes nervously ask, \\n\"What happens if the rope breaks?\" The answer is that you become \\nweightless and float inside the elevator, as though in outer space, \\nbecause both you and the elevator are falling at the same rate. Even \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Secret of Light: Vibrations in the Fifth Dimension \\n\\n\\n89 \\n\\n\\nthough both you and the elevator are accelerating in the earth\\'s gravi- \\ntational field, the acceleration is the same for both, and hence it appears \\nthat you are weightless in the elevator (at least until you reach the bot- \\ntom of the shaft). \\n\\nIn 1907, Einstein realized that a person floating in the elevator might \\nthink that someone had mysteriously turned off gravity. Einstein once \\nrecalled, \"I was sitting in a chair in the patent office at Bern when all of \\na sudden a thought occurred to me: \\'If a person falls freely he will not \\nfeel his own weight.\\' I was startled. This simple thought made a deep \\nimpression on me. It impelled me toward a theory of gravitation.\"\" Ein- \\nstein would call it \"the happiest thought of my life.\" \\n\\nReversing the situation, he knew that someone in an accelerating \\nrocket will feel a force pushing him into his seat, as though there were \\na gravitational pull on him. (In fact, the force of acceleration felt by our \\nastronauts is routinely measured in g\\'s \\xe2\\x80\\x94 that is, multiples of the force of \\nthe earth\\'s gravitation.) The conclusion he reached was that someone \\naccelerating in a speeding rocket may think that these forces were caused \\nby gravity. \\n\\nFrom this children\\'s question, Einstein grasped the fundamental \\nnature of gravitation: The laws of nature in an accelerating frame are equiv- \\nalent to the laws in a gravitational field. This simple statement, called the \\nequivalence principle, may not mean much to the average person, but once \\nagain, in the hands of Einstein, it became the foundation of a theory of \\nthe cosmos. \\n\\n(The equivalence principle also gives simple answers to complex \\nphysics questions. For example, if we are holding a helium balloon while \\nriding in a car, and the car suddenly swerves to the left, our bodies will \\nbe jolted to the right, but which way will the balloon move? Common \\nsense tells us that the balloon, like our bodies, will move to the right. \\nHowever, the correct resolution of this subtle question has stumped even \\nexperienced physicists. The answer is to use the equivalence principle. \\nImagine a gravitational field pulling on the car from the right. Gravity \\nwill make us lurch us to the right, so the helium balloon, which is lighter \\nthan air and always floats \"up,\" opposite the pull of gravity, must float \\nto the left, into the direction of the swerve, defying common sense.) \\n\\nEinstein exploited the equivalence principle to solve the long-stand- \\ning problem of whether a light beam is affected by gravity. Ordinarily, \\nthis is a highly nontrivial question. Through the equivalence principle, \\nhowever, the answer becomes obvious. If we shine a flashlight inside an \\naccelerating rocket, the light beam will bend downward toward the floor \\n(because the rocket has accelerated beneath the light beam during the \\n\\n\\n\\n90 \\n\\n\\nENTERING THE FIFTH DIMENSION \\n\\n\\ntime it takes for the light beam to move across the room). Therefore, \\nargued Einstein, a gravitational field will also bend the path of light. \\n\\nEinstein knew that a fundamental principle of physics is that a light \\nbeam will take the path requiring the least amount of time between two \\npoints. (This is called Fermat\\'s least-time principle.) Ordinarily, the path \\nwith the smallest time between two points is a straight line, so light beams \\nare straight. (Even when light bends upon entering glass, it still obeys \\nthe least-time principle. This is because light slows down in glass, and \\nthe path with the least time through a combination of air and glass is \\nnow a bent line. This is called refraction, which is the principle behind \\nmicroscopes and telescopes.)* \\n\\nHowever, if light takes the path with the least time between two \\npoints, and light beams bend under the influence of gravity, then the \\nshortest distance between two points is a curved line. Einstein was \\nshocked by this conclusion: If light could be observed traveling in a \\ncurved line, it would mean that space itself is curved. \\n\\n\\nSpace Warps \\n\\nAt the core of Einstein\\'s belief was the idea that \"force\" could be \\nexplained using pure geometry. For example, think of riding on a merry- \\ngo-round. Everyone knows that ifwe change horses on a merry-go-round, \\nwe feel a \"force\" tugging at us as we walk across the platform. Because \\nthe outer rim of the merry-go-round moves faster than the center, the \\nouter rim of the merry-go-round must shrink, according to special rel- \\nativity. However, if the platform of the merry-go-round now has a \\nshrunken rim or circumference, the platform as a whole must be curved. \\nTo someone on the platform, light no longer travels in a straight line, \\nas though a \"force\" were pulling it toward the rim. The usual theorems \\nof geometry no longer hold. Thus the \"force\" we feel while walking \\nbetween horses on a merry-go-round can be explained as the curving of \\nspace itself. \\n\\nEinstein independently discovered Riemann\\'s original program, to \\ngive a purely geometric explanation ofthe concept of \"force.\" We recall \\n\\n\\n*For example, imagine being a lifeguard on a beach, at some distance from the water; \\nout of the corner of your eye, you spy someone drowning in the ocean far off at an angle. \\nAssume that you can run very slowly in the soft sand, but can swim swiftly in the water. A \\nstraight path to the victim will spend too much time on the sand. The path with the least \\ntime is a bent line, one that reduces the time spent running on the sand and maximizes \\nthe time spent swimming in the water. \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Secret of Light: Vibrations in the Fifth Dimension \\n\\n\\n91 \\n\\n\\nthat Riemann used the analogy of Flatlanders living on a crumpled sheet \\nof paper. To us, it is obvious that Flatlanders moving over a wrinkled \\nsurface will be incapable of walking in a straight line. Whichever way \\nthey walk, they will experience a \"force\" that tugs at them from left and \\nright. To Riemann. the bending or warping of space causes the appear- \\nance of a force. Thus forces do not really exist; what is actually happen- \\ning is that space itself is being bent out of shape. \\n\\nThe problem with Riemann\\'s approach, however, was that he had \\nno idea specifically how gravity or electricity and magnetism caused the \\nwarping of space. His approach was purely mathematical, without any \\nconcrete physical picture of precisely how the bending of space was \\naccomplished. Here Einstein succeeded where Riemann failed. \\n\\nImagine, for example, a rock placed on a stretched bedsheet. Obvi- \\nously the rock will sink into the sheet, creating a smooth depression. A \\nsmall marble shot onto the bedsheet will then follow a circular or an \\nelliptical path around the rock. Someone looking from a distance at the \\nmarble orbiting around the rock may say that there is an \"instantaneous \\nforce\" emanating from the rock that alters the path of the marble. How- \\never, on close inspection it is easy to see what is really happening: The \\nrock has warped the bedsheet, and hence the path of the marble. \\n\\nBy analogy, if the planets orbit around the sun, it is because they are \\nmoving in space that has been curved by the presence of the sun. Thus \\nthe reason we are standing on the earth, rather than being hurled into \\nthe vacuum of outer space, is that the earth is constantly warping the \\nspace around us (Figure 4.1). \\n\\nEinstein noticed that the presence of the sun warps the path of light \\nfrom the distant stars. This simple physical picture therefore gave a way \\nin which the theory could be tested experimentally. First, we measure \\nthe position of the stars at night, when the sun is absent. Then, during \\nan eclipse of the sun, we measure the position of the stars, when the sun \\nis present (but doesn\\'t overwhelm the light from the stars). According \\nto Einstein, the apparent relative position of the stars should change \\nwhen the sun is present, because the sun\\'s gravitational field will have \\nbent the path of the light of those stars on its way to the earth. By com- \\nparing the photographs of the stars at night and the stars during an \\neclipse, one should be able to test this theory. \\n\\nThis picture can be summarized by what is called Mach\\'s principle, \\nthe guide Einstein used to create his general theory of relativity. We \\nrecall that the warping of the bedsheet was determined by the presence \\nof the rock. Einstein summarized this analogy by stating: The presence \\nof matter-energy determines the curvature of the space-time surround- \\ning it. This is the essence of the physical principle that Riemann failed \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 4.1. To Einstein, \" gravity \" was an illusion caused by the bending of \\nspace. Fie predicted that starlight moving around the sun would be bent, and \\nhence the relative positions of the stars should appear distored in the presence of \\nthe sun. This has been verified by repeated experiments. \\n\\n\\nto discover, that the bending of space is directly related to the amount \\nof energy and matter contained within that space. \\n\\nThis, in turn, can be summarized by Einstein\\'s famous equation,\\' \\nwhich essentially states: \\n\\nMatter-energy \\xe2\\x80\\x94 \\xc2\\xbb curvature of space-time \\n\\nwhere the arrow means \"determines.\" This deceptively short equation \\nis one of the greatest triumphs of the human mind. From it emerge the \\nprinciples behind the motions of stars and galaxies, black holes, the Big \\nBang, and perhaps the fate of the universe itself. \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Secret of Light: Vibrations in the Fifth Dimension \\n\\n\\n93 \\n\\n\\nNevertheless, Einstein was still missing a piece of the puzzle. He had \\ndiscovered the correct physical principle, but lacked a rigorous mathe- \\nmatical formalism powerful enough to express this principle. He lacked \\na version of Faraday\\'s fields for gravity. Ironically, Riemann had the \\nmathematical apparatus, but not the guiding physical principle. Ein- \\nstein, by contrast, discovered the physical principle, but lacked the math- \\nematical apparatus. \\n\\n\\nField Theory of Gravity \\n\\nBecause Einstein formulated this physical principle without knowing of \\nRiemann, he did not have the mathematical language or skill with which \\nto express his principle. He spent 3 long, frustrating years, from 1912 to \\n1915, in a desperate search for a mathematical formalism powerful \\nenough to express the principle. Einstein wrote a desperate letter to his \\nclose friend, mathematician Marcel Grossman, pleading, \"Grossman, \\nyou must help me or else I\\'ll go crazy!\"\" \\n\\nFortunately, Grossman, when combing through the library for clues \\nto Einstein\\'s problem, accidentally stumbled on the work of Riemann. \\nGrossman showed Einstein the work of Riemann and his metric tensor, \\nwhich had been ignored by physicists for 60 years. Einstein would later \\nrecall that Grossman \"checked through the literature and soon discov- \\nered that the mathematical problem had already been solved by Rie- \\nmann, Ricci, and Levi-Civita. . . . Riemann\\'s achievement was the great- \\nest one.\" \\n\\nTo his shock, Einstein found Riemann\\'s celebrated 1854 lecture to \\nbe the key to the problem. He found that he could incorporate the \\nentire body of Riemann\\'s work in the reformulation of his principle. \\nAlmost line for line, the great work of Riemann found its true home in \\nEinstein\\'s principle. This was Einstein\\'s proudest piece of work, even \\nmore than his celebrated equation E = me 2 . The physical reinterpreta- \\ntion ofRiemann\\'s famous 1854 lecture is now called general relativity, and \\nEinstein\\'s field equations rank among the most profound ideas in sci- \\nentific history. \\n\\nRiemann\\'s great contribution, we recall, was that he introduced the \\nconcept of the metric tensor, a field that is defined at all points in space. \\nThe metric tensor is not a single number. At each point in space, it \\nconsists of a collection of ten numbers. Einstein\\'s strategy was to follow \\nMaxwell and write down the field theory of gravity. The object of his \\nsearch for a field to describe gravity was found practically on the first \\n\\n\\n\\n94 \\n\\n\\nENTERING THE FIFTH DIMENSION \\n\\n\\npage ofRiemann\\'s lecture. In fact, Riemann\\'s metric tensor was precisely \\nthe Faraday field for gravity! \\n\\nWhen Einstein\\'s equations are fully expressed in terms ofRiemann\\'s \\nmetric tensor, they assume an elegance never before seen in physics. \\nNobel laureate Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar once called it \"the most \\nbeautiful theory there ever was.\" (In fact, Einstein\\'s theory is so simple \\nyet so powerful that physicists are sometimes puzzled as to why it works \\nso well. MIT physicist Victor Weisskopf once said, \"It\\'s like the peasant \\nwho asks the engineer how the steam engine works. The engineer \\nexplains to the peasant exactly where the steam goes and how it moves \\nthrough the engine and so on. And then the peasant says: \\'Yes, I under- \\nstand all that, but where is the horse?\\' That\\'s how I feel about general \\nrelativity. I know all the details, I understand where the steam goes, but \\nI\\'m still not sure I know where the horse is.\\'\\xe2\\x80\\x9d) \\n\\nIn retrospect, we now see how close Riemann came to discovering \\nthe theory of gravity 60 years before Einstein. The entire mathematical \\napparatus was in place in 1854. His equations were powerful enough to \\ndescribe the most complicated twisting of space-time in any dimension. \\nHowever, he lacked the physical picture (that matter-energy determines \\nthe curvature of space-time) and the keen physical insight that Einstein \\nprovided. \\n\\n\\nLiving in Curved Space \\n\\nI once attended a hockey game in Boston. All the action, of course, was \\nconcentrated on the hockey players as they glided on the ice rink. \\nBecause the puck was being rapidly battered back and forth between the \\nvarious players, it reminded me of how atoms exchange electrons when \\nthey form chemical elements or molecules. I noticed that the skating \\nrink, of course, did not participate in the game. It only marked the \\nvarious boundaries; it was a passive arena on which the hockey players \\nscored points. \\n\\nNext, I imagined what it must be like if the skating rink actively par- \\nticipated in the game: What would happen if the players were forced to \\nplay on an ice rink whose surface was curved, with rolling hills and steep \\nvalleys? \\n\\nThe hockey game would suddenly became more interesting. The \\nplayers would have to skate along a curved surface. The rink\\'s curvature \\nwould distort their motion, acting like a \"force\" pulling the players one \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Secret of Light: Vibrations in the Fifth Dimension \\n\\n\\n95 \\n\\n\\nway or another. The puck would move in a curved line like a snake, \\nmaking the game much more difficult. \\n\\nThen I imagined taking this one step further; I imagined that the \\nplayers were forced to play on a skating rink shaped like a cylinder. If \\nthe players could generate enough speed, they could skate upside down \\nand move entirely around the cylinder. New strategies could be devised, \\nsuch as ambushing an opposing player by skating upside down around \\nthe cylinder and catching him unawares. Once the ice rink was bent in \\nthe shape of a circle, space would become the decisive factor in explain- \\ning the motion of matter on its surface. \\n\\nAnother, more relevant example for our universe might be living in \\na curved space given by a hypersphere, a sphere in four dimensions. 1 \" \\nIf we look ahead, light will circle completely around the small perimeter \\nof the hypersphere and return to our eyes. Thus we will see someone \\nstanding in front of us, with his back facing us, a person who is wearing \\nthe same clothes as we are. We look disapprovingly at the unruly, \\nunkempt mass of hair on this person\\'s head, and then remember that \\nwe forgot to comb our hair that day. \\n\\nIs this person a fake image created by mirrors? To find out, we stretch \\nout our hand and put it on his shoulder. We find that the person in \\nfront of us is a real person, notjust a fake. If we look into the distance, \\nin fact, we see an infinite number of identical people, each facing for- \\nward. each with his hand on the shoulder of the person in front. \\n\\nBut what is most shocking is that we feel someone\\'s hand sneaking \\nup from behind, which then grabs our shoulder. Alarmed, we look back, \\nand see another infinite sequence of identical people behind us, with \\ntheir faces turned the other way. \\n\\nWhat\\'s really happening? We, of course, are the only person living \\nin this hypersphere. The person in front of us is really ourself. We are \\nstaring at the back of our own head. By placing our hand in front of us, \\nwe are really stretching our hand around the hypersphere, until we place \\nour hand on our own shoulder. \\n\\nThe counterintuitive stunts that are possible in a hypersphere are \\nphysically interesting because many cosmologists believe that our uni- \\nverse is actually a large hypersphere. There are also other equally strange \\ntopologies, like hyperdoughnuts and Mobius strips. Although they may \\nultimately have no practical application, they help to illustrate many of \\nthe features of living in hyperspace. \\n\\nFor example, let us assume that we are living on a hyperdoughnut. \\nIf we look to our left and right, we see, much to our surprise, a person \\non either side. Light circles completely around the larger perimeter of \\n\\n\\n\\n96 \\n\\n\\nENTERING THE FIFTH DIMENSION \\n\\n\\nthe doughnut, and returns to its starting point. Thus if we turn our heads \\nand look to the left, we see the right side of someone\\'s body. By turning \\nour heads the other way, we see someone\\'s left side. No matter how fast \\nwe turn our heads, the people ahead of us and to our sides turn their \\nheadsjust as fast, and we can never see their faces. \\n\\nNow imagine stretching our arms to either side. Both the person on \\nthe left and the one on the right will also stretch their arms. In fact, if \\nyou are close enough, you can grab the left and right hands of the per- \\nsons to either side. If you look carefully in either direction, you can see \\nan infinitely long, straight line of people all holding hands. If you look \\nahead, there is another infinite sequence of people standing before you, \\narranged in a straight line, all holding hands. \\n\\nWhat\\'s actually happening? In reality our arms are long enough to \\nreach around the doughnut, until the arms have touched. Thus we have \\nactually grabbed our own hands (Figure 4.2)! \\n\\nNow we find ourselves tiring of this charade. These people seem to \\nbe taunting us; they are copy-cats, doing exactly what we do. We get \\nannoyed \\xe2\\x80\\x94 so we get a gun and point it at the person in front of us. Just \\nbefore we pull the trigger, we ask ourselves: Is this person a fake mirror \\nimage? If so, then the bullet will go right through him. But if not, then \\nthe bullet will go completely around the universe and hit us in the back. \\nMaybe firing a gun in this universe is not such a good idea! \\n\\nFor an even more bizarre universe, imagine living on a Mobius strip, \\nwhich is like a long strip of paper twisted 180 degrees and then reglued \\nback together into a circular strip. When a right-handed Flatlander \\nmoves completely around the Mobius strip, he finds that he has become \\nleft-handed. Orientations are reversed when traveling around the uni- \\nverse. This is like H. G. Wells\\'s \"The Planner Story,\" in which the hero \\nreturns to earth after an accident to find that his body is completely \\nreversed; for example, his heart is on his right side. \\n\\nIf we lived on a hyper-Mobius strip, and we peered in front of us, we \\nwould see the back of someone\\'s head. At first, we wouldn\\'t think it \\ncould be our head, because the part of the hair would be on the wrong \\nside. If we reached out and placed our right hand on his shoulder, then \\nhe would lift up his left hand and place it on the shoulder of the person \\nahead of him. In fact, we would see an infinite chain of people with \\nhands on each other\\'s shoulders, except the hands would alternate from \\nthe left to the right shoulders. \\n\\nIf we left some of our friends at one spot and walked completely \\naround this universe, we would find that we had returned to our original \\nspot. But our friends would be shocked to find that our body was \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Secret of Light: Vibrations in the Fifth Dimension 97 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 4.2.

The part in our hair and the rings on our fingers would be on \\nthe wrong side, and our internal organs would have been reversed. Our \\nfriends would be amazed at the reversal of our body, and would ask if \\nwe felt well. In fact, we would feel completely normal; to us. it would be \\nour friends who had been completely turned around! An argument \\nwould now ensue over who was really reversed. \\n\\n\\n\\n98 \\n\\n\\nENTERING THE FIFTH DIMENSION \\n\\n\\nThese and other interesting possibilities open up when we live in a \\nuniverse where space and time are curved. No longer a passive arena, \\nspace becomes an active player in the drama unfolding in our universe. \\n\\nIn summary, we see that Einstein fulfilled the program initiated by \\nRiemann 60 years earlier, to use higher dimensions to simplify the laws \\nof nature. Einstein, however, went beyond Riemann in several ways. Like \\nRiemann before him, Einstein independently realized that \"force\" is a \\nconsequence of geometry, but unlike Riemann, Einstein was able to find \\nthe physical principle behind this geometry, that the curvature of space- \\ntime is due to the presence of matter-energy. Einstein, also like Rie- \\nmann, knew that gravitation can be described by a field, the metric ten- \\nsor, but Einstein was able to find the precise field equations that these \\nfields obey. \\n\\n\\nA Universe Made of Marble \\n\\nBy the mid-1920s, with the development of both special and general \\nrelativity, Einstein\\'s place in the history of science was assured. In 1921, \\nastronomers had verified that starlight indeed bends as it travels around \\nthe sun, precisely as Einstein had predicted. By then. Einstein was being \\ncelebrated as the successor to Isaac Newton. \\n\\nHowever, Einstein still was not satisfied. He would try one last time \\nto produce another world-class theory. But on his third try, he failed. \\nHis third and final theory was to have been the crowning achievement \\nof his lifetime. He was searching for the \"theory of everything,\" a theory \\nthat would explain all the familiar forces found in nature, including light \\nand gravity. He coined this theory the unified field theory. Alas, his search \\nfor a unified theory of light and gravity was fruitless. When he died, he \\nleft only the unfinished ideas of various manuscripts on his desk. \\n\\nIronically, the source ofEinstein\\'s frustration was the structure ofhis \\nown equation. For 30 years, he was disturbed by a fundamental flaw in \\nthis formulation. On one side of the equation was the curvature of \\nspace-time, which he likened to \"marble\" because of its beautiful geo- \\nmetric structure. To Einstein, the curvature of space-time was like the \\nepitome of Greek architecture, beautiful and serene. However, he hated \\nthe other side of this equation, describing matter-energy, which he con- \\nsidered to be ugly and which he compared to \"wood.\" While the \"mar- \\nble\" of space-time was clean and elegant, the \"wood\" of matter-energy \\nwas a horrible j umble of confused, seemingly random forms, from sub- \\natomic particles, atoms, polymers, and crystals to rocks, trees, planets. \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Secret of Light: Vibrations in the Fifth Dimension \\n\\n\\n99 \\n\\n\\nand stars. But in the 1920s and 1930s, when Einstein was actively working \\non the unified field theory, the true nature of matter remained an unsol- \\nved mystery. \\n\\nEinstein\\'s grand strategy was to turn wood into marble \\xe2\\x80\\x94 that is, to \\ngive a completely geometric origin to matter. But without more physical \\nclues and a deeper physical understanding of the wood, this was impos- \\nsible. By analogy, think of a magnificent, gnarled tree growing in the \\nmiddle of a park. Architects have surrounded this grizzled tree with a \\nplaza made ofbeautiful pieces of the purest marble. The architects have \\ncarefully assembled the marble pieces to resemble a dazzling floral pat- \\ntern with vines and roots emanating from the tree. To paraphrase \\nMach\\'s principle: The presence of the tree determines the pattern of \\nthe marble surrounding it. But Einstein hated this dichotomy between \\nwood, which seemed to be ugly and complicated, and marble, which was \\nsimple and pure. His dream was to turn the tree into marble; he would have \\nliked to have a plaza completely made of marble, with a beautiful, sym- \\nmetrical marble statue of a tree at its center. \\n\\nIn retrospect, we can probably spot Einstein\\'s error. We recall that \\nthe laws of nature simplify and unify in higher dimensions. Einstein \\ncorrectly applied this principle twice, in special and general relativity. \\nHowever, on his third try, he abandoned this fundamental principle. \\nVery little was known about the structure of atomic and nuclear matter \\nin his time; consequently, it was not clear how to use higher-dimensional \\nspace as a unifying principle. \\n\\nEinstein blindly tried a number of purely mathematical approaches. \\nHe apparently thought that \"matter\" could be viewed as kinks, vibra- \\ntions, or distortions of space-time. In this picture, matter was a concen- \\ntrated distortion of space. In other words, everything we see around us, \\nfrom the trees and clouds to the stars in the heavens, was probably an \\nillusion, some form of crumpling of hyperspace. However, without any \\nmore solid leads or experimental data, this idea led to a blind alley. \\n\\nIt would be left to an obscure mathematician to take the next step, \\nwhich would lead us to the fifth dimension. \\n\\n\\nThe Birth of Kaluza-Klein Theory \\n\\nIn April 1919, Einstein received a letter that left him speechless. \\n\\nIt was from an unknown mathematician, Theodr Kaluza, at the Uni- \\nversity of Konigsberg in Germany, in what is Kaliningrad in the former \\nSoviet Union. In a short article, only a few pages long, this obscure math- \\n\\n\\n\\n100 \\n\\n\\nENTERING THE FIFTH DIMENSION \\n\\n\\nematician was proposing a solution to one of the greatest problems of \\nthe century. Injust a few lines, Kaluza was uniting Einstein\\'s theory of \\ngravity with Maxwell\\'s theory of light by introducing the fifth dimension \\n(that is, four dimensions of space and one dimension of time). \\n\\nIn essence, he was resurrecting the old \"fourth dimension\" of Hin- \\nton and Zollner and incorporating it into Einstein\\'s theory in a fresh \\nfashion as the fifth dimension. Like Riemann before him, Kaluza \\nassumed that light is a disturbance caused by the rippling of this higher \\ndimension. The key difference separating this new work from Rie- \\nmann\\'s, Hinton\\'s, and Zollner\\'s was that Kaluza was proposing a genuine \\nfield theory. \\n\\nIn this short note, Kaluza began, innocently enough, by writing down \\nEinstein\\'s field equations for gravity in five dimensions, not the usual \\nfour. (Riemann\\'s metric tensor, we recall, can be formulated in any num- \\nber of dimensions.) Then he proceeded to show that these five-dimen- \\nsional equations contained within them Einstein\\'s earlier four-dimen- \\nsional theory (which was to be expected) with an additional piece. But \\nwhat shocked Einstein was that this additional piece was precisely Max- \\nwell\\'s theory of light. In other words, this unknown scientist was pro- \\nposing to combine, in one stroke, the two greatest field theories known \\nto science. Maxwell\\'s and Einstein\\'s, by mixing them in the fifth dimen- \\nsion. This was a theory made of pure marble \\xe2\\x80\\x94 that is, pure geometry. \\n\\nKaluza had found the first important clue in turning wood into mar- \\nble. In the analogy of the park, we recall that the marble plaza is two \\ndimensional. Kaluza\\'s observation was that we could build a \"tree\" of \\nmarble if we could move the pieces of marble up into the third dimen- \\nsion. \\n\\nTo the average layman, light and gravity have nothing in common. \\n\\nAfter all, light is a familiar force that comes in a spectacular variety of \\n\\ncolors and forms, while gravity is invisible and more distant. On the \\nearth, it is the electromagnetic force, not gravity, that has helped us tame \\nnature; it is the electromagnetic force that powers our machines, elec- \\ntrifies our cities, lights our neon signs, and brightens our television sets. \\nGravity, by contrast, operates on a larger scale; it is the force that guides \\nthe planets and keeps the sun from exploding. It is a cosmic force that \\npermeates the universe and binds the solar system. (Along with Weber \\nand Riemann. one of the first scientists to search actively for a link \\n\\nbetween light and gravity in the laboratory was Faraday himself. The \\n\\nactual experimental apparatus used by Faraday to measure the link \\nbetween these two forces can still be found in the Royal Institution in \\nPiccadilly, London. Although he failed experimentally to find any con- \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Secret of Light: Vibrations in the Fifth Dimension \\n\\n\\n101 \\n\\n\\nnection at all between the two forces, Faraday was confident of the power \\nof unification. He wrote, \"If the hope [of unification] should prove well \\nfounded, how great and mighty and sublime in its hitherto unchange- \\nable character is the force I am trying to deal with, and how large may \\nbe the new domain of knowledge that may be opened to the mind of \\nman.\" 11 ) \\n\\nEven mathematically, light and gravity are like oil and water. Max- \\nwell\\'s field theory of light requires four fields, while Einstein\\'s metric \\ntheory of gravity requires ten. Yet Kaluza\\'s paper was so elegant and \\ncompelling that Einstein could not reject it. \\n\\nAt first, it seemed like a cheap mathematical trick simply to expand \\nthe number or dimensions of space and time from four to five. This was \\nbecause, as we recall, there was no experimental evidence for the fourth \\nspatial dimension. What astonished Einstein was that once the five- \\ndimensional field theory was broken down to a four-dimensional field \\ntheory, both Maxwell\\'s and Einstein\\'s equations remained. In other \\nwords, Kaluza succeeded in joining the two pieces of the jigsaw puzzle \\nbecause both of them were part of a larger whole, a five-dimensional \\nspace. \\n\\n\"Light\" was emerging as the warping of the geometry of higher- \\ndimensional space. This was the theory that seemed to fulfill Riemann\\'s \\nold dream of explaining forces as the crumpling of a sheet of paper. In \\nhis article, Kaluza claimed that his theory, which synthesized the two \\nmost important theories up to that time, possessed \"virtually unsurpas- \\nsed formal unity.\" He furthermore insisted that the sheer simplicity and \\nbeauty of his theory could not \"amount to the mere alluring play of a \\ncapricious accident.\\'\"\" What shook Einstein was the audacity and sim- \\nplicity of the article. Like all great ideas, Kaluza\\'s essential argument was \\nelegant and compact. \\n\\nThe analogy with piecing together the parts of ajigsaw puzzle is a \\nmeaningful one. Recall that the basis of Riemann\\'s and Einstein\\'s work \\nis the metric tensor \\xe2\\x80\\x94 that is, a collection often numbers defined at each \\npoint in space. This was a natural generalization of Faraday\\'s field con- \\ncept. In Figure 2.2, we saw how these ten numbers can be arranged as \\nin the pieces of a checker board with dimensions 4X4 . We can denote \\nthese ten numbers as g\\xe2\\x80\\x9e, g\\xe2\\x80\\x9e .... Furthermore, the field of Maxwell is \\na collection of four numbers defined at each point in space. These four \\nnumbers can be represented by the symbols A,, A., A., A 4 . \\n\\nTo understand Kaluza\\'s trick, let us now begin with Riemann\\'s theory \\nin five dimensions. Then the metric tensor can be arranged in a 5 X 5 \\ncheckerboard. Now, by definition, we will rename the components of \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 4.3. Kaluza\\'s brilliant idea was to unite down the Riemann metric in five \\ndimensions. The fifth column and row are identified as the electromagnetic field \\nof Maxwell, while the remaining 4X4 block is the old four-dimensional metric \\nof Einstein. In one stroke, Kaluza unified the theory of gravity with light simply \\nby adding another dimension. \\n\\n\\n102 \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Secret of Light: Vibrations in the Fifth Dimension 103 \\n\\n\\nKaluza\\'s field, so that some of them become Einstein\\'s original field and \\nsome of them become Maxwell\\'s field (Figure 4.3). This is the essence \\nof Kaluza\\'s trick, which caught Einstein totally by surprise. By simply \\nadding Maxwell\\'s field to Einstein\\'s, Kaluza was able to reassemble both \\nof them into a five-dimensional field. \\n\\nNotice that there is \"enough room\" within the 15 components of \\nRiemann\\'s five-dimensional gravity to fit both the ten components of \\nEinstein\\'s field and the four components of Maxwell\\'s field! Thus Kalu- \\nza\\'s brilliant idea can be crudely summarized as \\n\\n15 = 10 + 4 + 1 \\n\\n(the leftover component is a scalar particle, which is unimportant for \\nour discussion). When carefully analyzing the full five-dimensional the- \\nory, we find that Maxwell\\'s field is nicely included within the Riemann \\nmetric tensor, just as Kaluza claimed. This innocent-looking equation \\nthus summarized one of the seminal ideas of the century. \\n\\nIn summary, the five-dimensional metric tensor included both Max- \\nwell\\'s field and Einstein\\'s metric tensor. It seemed incredible to Einstein \\nthat such a simple idea could explain the two most fundamental forces \\nof nature: gravity and light. \\n\\nWas itjust a parlor trick? Or numerology? Or black magic? Einstein \\nwas deeply shaken by Kaluza\\'s letter and, in fact, refused to respond to \\nthe article. He mulled over the letter for 2 years, an unusually long time \\nfor someone to hold up publication of an important article. Finally, \\nconvinced that this article was potentially important, he submitted it for \\npublication in the Sitzungsberichte Preussische Akademie der Wissenschaften. \\nIt bore the imposing title \"On the Unity Problem of Physics.\" \\n\\nIn the history of physics, no one had found any use for the fourth \\nspatial dimension. Ever since Riemann, it was known that the mathe- \\nmatics of higher dimensions was one of breathtaking beauty, but without \\nphysical application. For the first time, someone had found a use for the \\nfourth spatial dimension: to unite the laws of physics! In some sense, \\nKaluza was proposing that the four dimensions of Einstein were \"too \\nsmall\" to accommodate both the electromagnetic and gravitational \\nforces. \\n\\nWe can also see historically that Kaluza\\'s work was not totally unex- \\npected. Most historians of science, when they mention Kaluza\\'s work at \\nall, say that the idea of a fifth dimension was a bolt out of the blue, totally \\nunexpected and original. Given the continuity of physics research, these \\nhistorians are startled to find a new avenue of science opening up with- \\n\\n\\n\\n104 \\n\\n\\nENTERING THE FIFTH DIMENSION \\n\\n\\nout any historical precedent. But their amazement is probably due to \\ntheir unfamiliarity with the nonscientific work of the mystics, literati, \\nand avante garde. A closer look at the cultural and historical setting \\nshows that Kaluza\\'s work was not such an unexpected development. As \\nwe have seen, because of Hinton, Zollner, and others, the possible exis- \\ntence of higher dimensions was perhaps the single most popular quasi- \\nscientific idea circulating within the arts. From this larger cultural point \\nof view, it was only a matter of time before some physicist took seriously \\nHinton\\'s widely known idea that light is a vibration of the fourth spatial \\ndimension. In this sense, the work of Riemann pollinated the world of \\narts and letters via Hinton and Zollner, and then probably cross-polli- \\nnated back into the world of science through the work of Kaluza. (In \\nsupport of this thesis, it was recently revealed by Freund that Kaluza was \\nactually not the first one to propose a five-dimensional theory of gravity. \\nGunnar Nordstrom, a rival of Einstein, actually published the first five- \\ndimensional field theory, but it was too primitive to include both Ein- \\nstein\\'s and Maxwell\\'s theories. The fact that both Kaluza and Nordstrom \\nindependently tried to exploit the fifth dimension indicates that the \\nconcepts widely circulating within popular culture affected their think- \\ning. 13 ) \\n\\n\\nThe Fifth Dimension \\n\\nEvery physicist receives quite a jolt when confronting the fifth dimension \\nfor the first time. Peter Freund remembers clearly the precise moment \\nwhen he first encountered the fifth and higher dimensions. It was an \\nevent that left a deep impression on his thinking. \\n\\nIt was 1953 in Romania, the country of Freund\\'s birth. Joseph Stalin \\nhadjust died, an important event that led to a considerable relaxation \\nof tensions. Freund was a precocious college freshman that year, and he \\nattended a talk by George Vranceanu. He vividly remembers hearing \\nVranceanu discuss the important question: Why should light and gravity \\nbe so disparate? Then the lecturer mentioned an old theory that could \\ncontain both the theory of light and Einstein\\'s equations of gravity. The \\nsecret was to use Kaluza-Klein theory, which was formulated in five \\ndimensions. \\n\\nFreund was shocked. Here was a brilliant idea that took him com- \\npletely by surprise. Although only a freshman, he had the audacity to \\npose the obvious question: How does this Kaluza-Klein theory explain \\nthe other forces? He asked, \"Even if you achieve a unification of light \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Secret of Light: Vibrations in the Fifth Dimension 105 \\n\\n\\nand gravity, you will not achieve anything because there is still the \\nnuclear force.\" He realized that the nuclear force was outside Kaluza- \\nKlein theory. (In fact, the hydrogen bomb, which hung like a sword over \\neveryone on the planet at the height of the Cold War, was based on \\nunleashing the nuclear force, not electromagnetism or gravity.) \\n\\nThe lecturer had no answer. In his youthful enthusiasm, Freund \\nblurted out, \"What about adding more dimensions?\" \\n\\n\"But how many more dimensions?\" asked the lecturer. \\n\\nFreund was caught off guard. He did not want to give a low number \\nof dimensions, only to be scooped by someone else. So he proposed a \\nnumber that no one could possibly top: an infinite number of dimen- \\nsions! 14 (Unfortunately for this precocious physicist, an infinite number \\nof dimensions does not seem to be physically possible.) \\n\\n\\nLife on a Cylinder \\n\\nAfter the initial shock of confronting the fifth dimension, most physicists \\ninvariably begin to ask questions. In fact, Kaluza\\'s theory raised more \\nquestions than it answered. The obvious question to ask Kaluza was: \\nWhere is the fifth dimension? Since all earthly experiments showed con- \\nclusively that we live in a universe with three dimensions of space and \\none of time, the embarrassing question still remained. \\n\\nKaluza had a clever response. His solution was essentially the same \\nas that proposed by Hinton years before, that the higher dimension, \\nwhich was not observable by experiment, was different from the other \\ndimensions. It had, in fact, collapsed down to a circle so small that even \\natoms could not fit inside it. Thus the fifth dimension was not a math- \\nematical trick introduced to manipulate electromagnetism and gravity, \\nbut a physical dimension that provided the glue to unite these two fun- \\ndamental forces into one force, but wasjust too small to measure. \\n\\nAnyone walking in the direction of the fifth dimension would even- \\ntually find himself back where he started. This is because the fifth dimen- \\nsion is topologically identical to a circle, and the universe is topologically \\nidentical to a cylinder. \\n\\nFreund explains it this way: \\n\\nThink of some imaginary people living in Lineland, which consists of a \\nsingle line. Throughout their history, they believed that their world was \\njust a single line. Then, a scientist in Lineland proposed that their world \\nwas notjust a one-dimensional line, but a two-dimensional world. When \\n\\n\\n\\n106 \\n\\n\\nENTERING THE FIFTH DIMENSION \\n\\n\\nasked where this mysterious and unobservable second dimension was, he \\nwould reply that the second dimension was curled up into a small ball. \\nThus, the line people actually live on the surface of a long, but very thin, \\ncylinder. The radius of the cylinder is too small to be measured; it is so \\nsmall, in fact, that it appears that the world is just a line. 15 \\n\\n\\nIf the radius of the cylinder were larger, the line people could move \\noff their universe and move perpendicular to their line world. In other \\nwords, they could perform interdimensional travel. As they moved per- \\npendicular to Lineland, they would encounter an infinite number of \\nparallel line worlds that coexisted with their universe. As they moved \\nfarther into the second dimension, they would eventually return to their \\nown line world. \\n\\nNow think of Flatlanders living on a plane. Likewise, a scientist on \\nFlatland may make the outrageous claim that traveling through the third \\ndimension is possible. In principle, a Flatlander could rise off the surface \\nof Flatland. As this Flatlander slowly floated upward in the third dimen- \\nsion, his \"eyes\" would see an incredible sequence of different parallel \\nuniverses, each coexisting with his universe. Because his eyes would be \\nable to see only parallel to the surface ofFlatland, he would see different \\nFlatland universes appearing before him. If the Flatlander drifted too \\nfar above the plane, eventually he would return to his original Flatland \\nuniverse. \\n\\nNow, imagine that our present three-dimensional world actually has \\nanother dimension that has curled up into a circle. For the sake of argu- \\nment, assume that the fifth dimension is 10 feet long. By leaping into \\nthe fifth dimension, we simply disappear instantly from our present uni- \\nverse. Once we move in the fifth dimension, we find that, after moving \\n10 feet, we are back where we started from. But why did the fifth dimen- \\nsion curl up into a circle in the first place? In 1926, the mathematician \\nOskar Klein made several improvements on the theory, stating that per- \\nhaps the quantum theory could explain why the fifth dimension rolled \\nup. On this basis, he calculated that the size of the fifth dimension \\nshould be 10 centimeters (the Planck length), which is much too \\nsmall for any earthly experiment to detect its presence. (This is the same \\nargument used today to justify the ten-dimensional theory.) \\n\\nOn the one hand, this meant that the theory was in agreement with \\nexperiment because the fifth dimension was too small to be measured. \\nOn the other hand, it also meant that the fifth dimension was so fantas- \\ntically small that one could never build machines powerful enough to \\nprove the theory was really correct. (The quantum physicist Wolfgang \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Secret of Light: Vibrations in the Fifth Dimension 107 \\n\\n\\nPauli, in his usual caustic way, would dismiss theories he didn\\'t like by \\nsaying, \"It isn\\'t even wrong.\" In other words, they were so half-baked \\nthat one could not even determine if they were correct. Given the fact \\nthat Kaluza\\'s theory could not be tested, one could also say that it wasn\\'t \\neven wrong.) \\n\\n\\nThe Death of Kaluza-Klein Theory \\n\\nAs promising as Kaluza-Klein theory was for giving a purely geometric \\nfoundation to the forces of nature, by the 1930s the theory was dead. \\nOn the one hand, physicists weren\\'t convinced that the fifth dimension \\nreally existed. Klein\\'s conjecture that the fifth dimension was curled up \\ninto a tiny circle the size of the Planck length was untestable. The energy \\nnecessary to probe this tiny distance can be computed, and it is called \\nthe Planck energy, or 10\" billion electron volts. This fabulous energy is \\nalmost beyond comprehension. It is 100 billion billion times the energy \\nlocked in a proton, an energy beyond anything we will be able to pro- \\nduce within the next several centuries. \\n\\nOn the other hand, physicists left this area of research in droves \\nbecause of the discovery of a new theory that was revolutionizing the \\nworld of science. The tidal wave unleashed by this theory of the sub- \\natomic world completely swamped research in Kaluza-Klein theory. The \\nnew theory was called quantum mechanics, and it sounded the death \\nknell for Kaluza-Klein theory for the next 60 years. Worse, quantum \\nmechanics challenged the smooth, geometric interpretation of forces, \\nreplacing it with discrete packets of energy. \\n\\nWas the program initiated by Riemann and Einstein completely \\nwrong? \\n\\n\\n\\nPART II \\n\\n\\nUnification in \\nTen Dimensions \\n\\n\\n\\n5 \\n\\nQuantum Heresy \\n\\n\\nAnyone who is not shocked by the quantum theory does not \\nunderstand it. \\n\\n\\nNiels Bohr \\n\\n\\nA Universe Made of Wood \\n\\n\\nI N 1925, a new theory burst into existence. With dizzying, almost mete- \\n-M_oric speed, this theory overthrew long-cherished notions about mat- \\nter that had been held since the time of the Greeks. Almost effortlessly, \\nit vanquished scores of long-standing fundamental problems that had \\nstumped physicists for centuries. What is matter made of? What holds it \\ntogether? Why does it come in an infinite variety of forms, such as gases, \\nmetals, rocks, liquids, crystals, ceramics, glasses, lightning bolts, stars, \\nand so on? \\n\\nThe new theory was christened quantum mechanics, and gave us the \\nfirst comprehensive formulation with which to pry open the secrets of \\nthe atom. The subatomic world, once a forbidden realm for physicists, \\nnow began to spill its secrets into the open. \\n\\nTo understand the speed with which this revolution demolished its \\nrivals, we note that in the early 1920s some scientists still held serious \\nreservations about the existence of \"atoms.\" What couldn\\'t be seen or \\nmeasured directly in the laboratory, they scoffed, didn\\'t exist. But by \\n1925 and 1926, Erwin Schrodinger, Werner Heisenberg, and others had \\n\\n\\n111 \\n\\n\\n\\n112 \\n\\n\\nUNIFICATION IN TEN DIMENSIONS \\n\\n\\ndeveloped an almost complete mathematical description of the hydro- \\ngen atom. With devastating precision, they could now explain nearly all \\nthe properties of the hydrogen atom from pure mathematics. By 1930, \\nquantum physicists such as Paul A. M. Dirac were declaring that all of \\nchemistry could be derived from first principles. They even made the \\nbrash claim that, given enough time on a calculating machine, they \\ncould predict all the chemical properties of matter found in the uni- \\nverse. To them, chemistry would no longer be a fundamental science. \\nFrom now on, it would be \"applied physics.\" \\n\\nNot only did its dazzling rise include a definitive explanation of the \\nbizarre properties of the atomic world; but quantum mechanics also \\neclipsed Einstein\\'s work for many decades: One of the first casualties of \\nthe quantum revolution was Einstein\\'s geometric theory of the universe. \\nIn the halls of the Institute for Advanced Study, young physicists began \\nto whisper that Einstein was over the hill, that the quantum revolution \\nhad bypassed him completely. The younger generation rushed to read \\nthe latest papers written about quantum theory, not those about the \\ntheory of relativity. Even the director of the institute, J. Robert Oppen- \\nheimer, confided privately to his close friends that Einstein\\'s work was \\nhopelessly behind the times. Even Einstein began to think of himself as \\nan \"old relic.\" \\n\\nEinstein\\'s dream, we recall, was to create a universe made of \"mar- \\nble\" \\xe2\\x80\\x94 that is, pure geometry. Einstein was repelled by the relative ugli- \\nness of matter, with its confusing, anarchistic jumble of forms, which he \\ncalled \"wood.\" Einstein\\'s goal was to banish this blemish from his the- \\nories forever, to turn wood into marble. His ultimate hope was to create \\na theory of the universe based entirely on marble. To his horror, Einstein \\nrealized that the quantum theory was a theory made entirely of wood! \\nIronically, it now appeared that he had made a monumental blunder, \\nthat the universe apparently preferred wood to marble. \\n\\nIn the analogy between wood and marble, we recall that Einstein \\nwanted to convert the tree in the marble plaza to a marble statue, cre- \\nating a park completely made of marble. The quantum physicists, how- \\never, approached the problem from the opposite perspective. Their \\ndream was to take a sledge hammer and pulverize all the marble. After \\nremoving the shattered marble pieces, they would cover the park com- \\npletely with wood. \\n\\nQuantum theory, in fact, turned Einstein on his head. In almost every \\nsense of the word, quantum theory is the opposite of Einstein\\'s theory. \\nEinstein\\'s general relativity is a theory of the cosmos, a theory of stars \\n\\n\\n\\nQuantum Heresy \\n\\n\\n113 \\n\\n\\nand galaxies held together via the smooth fabric of space and time. \\nQuantum theory, by contrast, is a theory of the microcosm, where sub- \\natomic particles are held together by particlelike forces dancing on the \\nsterile stage of space-time, which is viewed as an empty arena, devoid of \\nany content. Thus the two theories are hostile opposites. In fact, the \\ntidal wave generated by the quantum revolution swamped all attempts \\nat a geometric understanding of forces for over a half-century. \\n\\nThroughout this book, we have developed the theme that the laws \\nof physics appear simple and unified in higher dimensions. However, \\nwith the appearance of the quantum heresy after 1925, we see the first \\nserious challenge to this theme. In fact, for the next 60 years, until the \\nmid-1980s, the ideology of the quantum heretics would dominate the \\nworld of physics, almost burying the geometric ideas of Riemann and \\nEinstein under an avalanche of undeniable successes and stunning \\nexperimental victories. \\n\\nFairly rapidly, quantum theory began to give us a comprehensive \\nframework in which to describe the visible universe: The material uni- \\nverse consists of atoms and its constituents. There are about 100 different \\ntypes of atoms, or elements, out of which we can build all the known \\nforms of matter found on earth and even in outer space. Atoms, in turn, \\nconsist of electrons orbiting around nuclei, which in turn are composed \\nof neutrons and protons. In essence, the key differences between Ein- \\nstein\\'s beautiful geometric theory and quantum theory can now be sum- \\nmarized as follows. \\n\\n1. Forces are created by the exchange of discrete packets of energy, \\ncalled quanta. \\n\\nIn contrast to Einstein\\'s geometric picture of a \"force,\" in quantum \\ntheory light was to be chopped up into tiny pieces. These packets of light \\nwere named photons, and they behave very much like point particles. \\nWhen two electrons bump into each other, they repel each other not \\nbecause of the curvature of space, but because they exchange a packet \\nof energy, the photon. \\n\\nThe energy of these photons is measured in units of something called \\nPlanck\\'s constant (hbar ~ 10 \\xe2\\x80\\x9d erg sec). The almost infinitesimal size of \\nPlanck\\'s constant means that quantum theory gives tiny corrections to \\nNewton\\'s laws. These are called quantum corrections, and can be neglected \\nwhen describing our familiar, macroscopic world. That is why we can, \\nfor the most part, forget about quantum theory when describing every- \\nday phenomena. However, when dealing with the microscopic sub- \\n\\n\\n\\n114 \\n\\n\\nUNIFICATION IN TEN DIMENSIONS \\n\\n\\natomic world, these quantum corrections begin to dominate any physical \\nprocess, accounting for the bizarre, counterintuitive properties of sub- \\natomic particles. \\n\\n2. Different forces are caused by the exchange of different quanta. \\n\\nThe weak force, for example, is caused by the exchange of a different \\ntype of quantum, called a W particle (W stands for \"weak\"). Similarly, \\nthe strong force holding the protons and neutrons together within the \\nnucleus of the atom is caused by the exchange of subatomic particles \\ncalled pi mesons. Both Wbosons and pi mesons have been seen experi- \\nmentally in the debris of atom smashers, thereby verifying the funda- \\nmental correctness of this approach. And finally, the subnuclear force \\nholding the protons and neutrons and even the pi mesons together are \\ncalled gluons. \\n\\nIn this way, we have a new \"unifying principle\" for the laws ofphysics. \\nWe can unite the laws of electromagnetism, the weak force, and the \\nstrong force by postulating a variety of different quanta that mediate \\nthem. Three of the four forces (excluding gravity) are therefore united \\nby quantum theory, giving us unification without geometry, which \\nappears to contradict the theme of this book and everything we have \\nconsidered so far. \\n\\n3. We can never know simultaneously the velocity and position of a \\nsubatomic particle. \\n\\nThis is the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which is by far the most \\ncontroversial aspect of the theory, but one that has resisted every chal- \\nlenge in the laboratory for half a century. There is no known experi- \\nmental deviation to this rule. \\n\\nThe Uncertainty Principle means that we can never be sure where \\nan electron is or what its velocity is. The best we can do is to calculate \\nthe probability that the electron will appear at a certain place with a \\ncertain velocity. The situation is not as hopeless as one might suspect, \\nbecause we can calculate with mathematical rigor the probability of find- \\ning that electron. Although the electron is a point particle, it is accom- \\npanied by a wave that obeys a well-defined equation, the Schrodinger \\nwave equation. Roughly speaking, the larger the wave, the greater the \\nprobability of finding the electron at that point. \\n\\nThus quantum theory merges concepts ofboth particle and wave into \\na nice dialectic: The fundamental physical objects of nature are particles, \\nbut the probability of finding a particle at any given place in space and \\n\\n\\n\\nQuantum Heresy \\n\\n\\n115 \\n\\n\\ntime is given by a probability wave. This wave, in turn, obeys a well- \\ndefined mathematical equation given by Schrodinger. \\n\\nWhat is so crazy about the quantum theory is that it reduces every- \\nthing to these baffling probabilities. We can predict with great precision \\nhow many electrons in a beam will scatter when moving through a screen \\nwith holes in it. However, we can never know precisely which electron \\nwill scatter in which direction. This is not a matter of having crude instru- \\nments; according to Heisenberg, it is a law of nature. \\n\\nThis formulation, of course, had unsettling philosophical implica- \\ntions. The Newtonian vision held that the universe was a gigantic clock, \\nwound at the beginning of time and ticking ever since because it obeyed \\nNewton\\'s three laws of motion; this picture of the universe was now \\nreplaced by uncertainty and chance. Quantum theory demolished, once \\nand for all, the Newtonian dream of mathematically predicting the \\nmotion of all the particles in the universe. \\n\\nIf quantum theory violates our common sense, it is only because \\nnature does not seem to care much about our common sense. As alien \\nand disturbing as these ideas may seem, they can be readily verified in \\nthe laboratory. This is illustrated by the celebrated double-slit experi- \\nment. Let us say we fire a beam of electrons at a screen with two small \\nslits. Behind the screen, there is sensitive photographic paper. According \\nto nineteenth-century classical physics, there should be two tiny spots \\nburned into the photographic paper by the beam of electrons behind \\neach hole. However, when the experiment is actually performed in the \\nlaboratory, we find an interference pattern (a series of bright and dark \\nlines) on the photographic paper, which is commonly associated with \\nwavelike, not particlelike, behavior (Figure 5.1). (The simplest way of \\ncreating an interference pattern is to take a quiet bath and then rhyth- \\nmically splash waves on the water\\'s surface. The spiderweblike pattern \\nof waves criss-crossing the surface of the water is an interference pattern \\ncaused by the collision of many wave fronts.) The pattern on the pho- \\ntographic sheet corresponds to a wave that has penetrated both holes \\nsimultaneously and then interfered with itself behind the screen. Since \\nthe interference pattern is created by the collective motion of many \\nindividual electrons, and since the wave has gone through both holes \\nsimultaneously, naively we come to the absurd conclusion that electrons \\ncan somehow enter both holes simultaneously. But how can an electron \\nbe in two places at the same time? According to quantum theory, the \\nelectron is indeed a point particle that went through one or the other \\nhole, but the wave function of the electron spread out over space, went \\n\\n\\n\\n116 \\n\\n\\nUNIFICATION IN TEN DIMENSIONS \\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 5.1. A beam of electrons is shot through two small holes and exposes some \\nfilm. We expect to see two dots on the film. Instead, we find an undulating \\ninterference pattern. Flow can this be? According to quantum theory, the electron \\nis indeed a pointlike particle and cannot go through both holes, but the Schro- \\ndinger wave associated with each electron can pass through both holes and inter- \\nfere with itself. \\n\\nthrough both holes, and then interacted with itself. As unsettling as this \\nidea is, it has been verified repeatedly by experiment. As physicist Sir \\nJames Jeans once said, \"It is probably as meaningless to discuss how \\nmuch room an electron takes up as it is to discuss how much room a \\nfear, an anxiety, or an uncertainty takes up.\\'\" (A bumper sticker I once \\nsaw in Germany summed this up succinctly. It read. \"Heisenberg may \\nhave slept here.\") \\n\\n4. There is a finite probability that particles may \"tunnel\" through \\nor make a quantum leap through impenetrable barriers. \\n\\nThis is one of more stunning predictions of quantum theory. On the \\natomic level, this prediction has had nothing less than spectacular suc- \\ncess. \"Tunneling,\" or quantum leaps through barriers, has survived \\nevery experimental challenge. In fact, a world without tunneling is now \\nunimaginable. \\n\\nOne simple experiment that demonstrates the correctness of quan- \\ntum tunneling starts by placing an electron in a box. Normally, the elec- \\ntron does not have enough energy to penetrate the walls of the box. If \\n\\n\\n\\nQuantum Heresy \\n\\n\\n117 \\n\\n\\nclassical physics is correct, then the electron would never leave the box. \\nHowever, according to quantum theory, the electron\\'s probability wave \\nwill spread through the box and seep into the outside world. The seep- \\nage through the wall can be calculated precisely with the Schrodinger \\nwave equation; that is, there is a small probability that the electron\\'s \\nposition is somewhere outside the box. Another way of saying this is that \\nthere is a finite but small probability that the electron will tunnel its way \\nthrough the barrier (the wall of the box) and emerge from the box. In \\nthe laboratory, when one measures the rate at which electrons tunnel \\nthrough these barriers, the numbers agree precisely with the quantum \\ntheory. \\n\\nThis quantum tunneling is the secret behind the tunnel diode, which \\nis a purely quantum-mechanical device. Normally, electricity might not \\nhave enough energy to penetrate past the tunnel diode. However, the \\nwave function of these electrons can penetrate through barriers in the \\ndiode, so there is a non-negligible probability that electricity will emerge \\non the other side of the barrier by tunneling through it. When you listen \\nto the beautiful sounds of stereo music, remember that you are listening \\nto the rhythms of trillions of electrons obeying this and other bizarre \\nlaws of quantum mechanics. \\n\\nBut if quantum mechanics were incorrect, then all of electronics, \\nincluding television sets, computers, radios, stereo, and so on. would \\ncease to function. (In fact, if quantum theory were incorrect, the atoms \\nin our bodies would collapse, and we would instantly disintegrate. \\nAccording to Maxwell\\'s equations, the electrons spinning in an atom \\nshould lose their energy within a microsecond and plunge into the \\nnucleus. This sudden collapse is prevented by quantum theory. Thus the \\nfact that we exist is living proof of the correctness of quantum \\nmechanics.) \\n\\nThis also means that there is a finite, calculable probability that \\n\"impossible\" events will occur. For example, I can calculate the proba- \\nbility that I will unexpectedly disappear and tunnel through the earth \\nand reappear in Hawaii. (The time we would have to wait for such an \\nevent to occur, it should be pointed out, is longer than the lifetime of \\nthe universe. So we cannot use quantum mechanics to tunnel to vacation \\nspots around the world.) \\n\\nThe Yang-Mills Field, Successor to Maxwell \\n\\nQuantum physics, after an initial flush of success in the 1930s and 1940s \\nunprecedented in the history of science, began to run out of steam by \\n\\n\\n\\n118 \\n\\n\\nUNIFICATION IN TEN DIMENSIONS \\n\\n\\nthe 1960s. Powerful atom smashers built to break up the nucleus of the \\natom found hundreds of mysterious particles among the debris. Physi- \\ncists, in fact, were deluged by mountains of experimental data spewing \\nfrom these particle accelerators. \\n\\nWhile Einstein guessed the entire framework of general relativity \\nwith only physical intuition, particle physicists were drowning in a mass \\nof experimental data in the 1960s. As Enrico Fermi, one of the builders \\nof the atomic bomb, confessed, \"If I could remember the names of all \\nthese particles, I would have become a botanist.\" As hundreds of \"ele- \\nmentary\" particles were discovered in the debris of smashed atoms, par- \\nticle physicists would propose innumerable schemes to explain them, all \\nwithout luck. So great were the number of incorrect schemes that it was \\nsometimes said that the half-life of a theory of subatomic physics is only \\n2 years. \\n\\nLooking back at all the blind alleys and false starts in particle physics \\nduring that period, one is reminded of the story of the scientist and the \\nflea. \\n\\nA scientist once trained a flea tojump whenever he rang a bell. Using \\na microscope, he then anesthetized one of the flea\\'s legs and rang the \\nbell again. The flea stilljumped. \\n\\nThe scientist then anesthetized another leg and then rang the bell. \\nThe flea stilljumped. \\n\\nEventually, the scientist anesthetized more and more legs, each time \\nringing the bell, and each time recording that the fleajumped. \\n\\nFinally, the flea had only one leg left. When the scientist anesthetized \\nthe last leg and rang the bell, he found to his surprise that the flea no \\nlonger jumped. \\n\\nThen the scientist solemnly declared his conclusion, based on irref- \\nutable scientific data: Fleas hear through their legs! \\n\\nAlthough high-energy physicists have often felt like the scientist in \\nthat story, over the decades a consistent quantum theory of matter has \\nslowly emerged. In 1971, the key development that propelled a unified \\ndescription of three of the quantum forces (excluding gravity) and \\nchanged the landscape of theoretical physics was made by a Dutch grad- \\nuate student, Gerard \\'t Hooft, who was still in his twenties. \\n\\nBased on the analogy with photons, the quanta of light, physicists \\nbelieved that the weak and strong forces were caused by the exchange \\nof a quantum of energy, called the Yang-Mills field. Discovered by C. N. \\nYang and his student R. L. Mills in 1954, the Yang-Mills field is a gen- \\neralization of the Maxwell field introduced a century earlier to describe \\nlight, except that the Yang-Mills field has many more components and \\n\\n\\n\\nQuantum Heresy \\n\\n\\n119 \\n\\n\\ncan have an electrical charge (the photon carries no electrical charge). \\nFor the weak interactions, the quantum corresponding to the Yang-Mills \\nfield is the W particle, which can have charge +1,0, and \\xe2\\x80\\x94 1. For the \\nstrong interactions, the quantum corresponding to the Yang-Mills field, \\nthe \"glue\" that holds the protons and neutrons together, was christened \\nthe gluon. \\n\\nAlthough this general picture was compelling, the problem that \\nbedeviled physicists in the 1950s and 1960s was that the Yang-Mills field \\nis not \"renormalizable\"; that is, it does notyield finite, meaningful quan- \\ntities when applied to simple interactions. This rendered quantum the- \\nory useless in describing the weak and strong interactions. Quantum \\nphysics had hit a brick wall. \\n\\nThis problem arose because physicists, when they calculate what hap- \\npens when two particles bump into each other, use something called \\nperturbation theory, which is a fancy way of saying they use clever approx- \\nimations. For example, in Figure 5.2(a), we see what happens when an \\nelectron bumps into another weakly interacting particle, the elusive neu- \\ntrino. As a first guess, this interaction can be described by a diagram \\n(called a Feynman diagram) showing that a quantum of the weak inter- \\nactions, the W particle, is exchanged between the electron and the neu- \\ntrino. To a first approximation, this gives us a crude but reasonable fit \\nto the experimental data. \\n\\nBut according to quantum theory, we must also add small quantum \\ncorrections to our first guess. To make our calculation rigorous, we must \\nalso add in the Feynman diagrams for all possible graphs, including ones \\nthat have \"loops\" in them, as in Figure 5.2(b). Ideally, these quantum \\ncorrections should be tiny. After all, as we mentioned earlier, quantum \\ntheory was meant to give tiny quantum corrections to Newtonian physics. \\nBut much to the horror of physicists, these quantum corrections, or \\n\"loop graphs,\" instead of being small, were infinite. No matter how \\nphysicists tinkered with their equations or tried to disguise these infinite \\nquantities, these divergences were persistently found in any calculation \\nof quantum corrections. \\n\\nFurthermore, the Yang-Mills field had a formidable reputation of \\nbeing devilishly hard to calculate with, compared with the simpler Max- \\nwell field. There was a mythology surrounding the Yang-Mills field that \\nheld that it was simply too complicated for practical calculations. Per- \\nhaps it was fortunate that \\'t Hooft was only a graduate student and wasn\\'t \\ninfluenced by the prejudices of more \"seasoned\" physicists. Using tech- \\nniques pioneered by his thesis adviser, Martinus Veltman, \\'t Hooft \\nshowed that whenever we have \"symmetry breaking\" (which we will \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 5.2. (a) In quantum theory, when subatomic particles bump into one \\n\\nanother, they exchange packets of energy, or quanta. Electrons and neutrinos \\ninteract by exchanging a quantum of the weak force, called the W particle, (b) To \\ncalculate the complete interaction of electrons and neutrinos, we must add up an \\ninfinite series of graphs, called Feynman diagrams, where the quanta are \\nexchanged in increasingly complicated geometric patterns. This process of adding \\nup an infinite series of Feynman graphs is called perturbation theory. \\n\\n\\n120 \\n\\n\\n\\nQuantum Heresy \\n\\n\\n121 \\n\\n\\nexplain later), the Yang-Mills field acquires a mass but remains a finite \\ntheory. He demonstrated that the infinities due to the loop graphs can \\nall be canceled or shuffled around until they become harmless. \\n\\nAlmost 20 years after its being proposed by Yang and Mills, \\'t Hooft \\nfinally showed that the Yang-Mills field is a well-defined theory of par- \\nticle interactions. News of \\'t Hooft\\'s work spread like a flash fire. Nobel \\nlaureate Sheldon Glashow remembers that when he heard the news, he \\nexclaimed, \"Either this guy\\'s a total idiot, or he\\'s the biggest genius to \\nhit physics in years!\\'\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Developments came thick and fast. An earlier \\ntheory of the weak interactions, proposed in 1967 by Steven Weinberg \\nand Abdus Salam, was rapidly shown to be the correct theory of the weak \\ninteractions. By the mid-1970s, the Yang-Mills field was applied to the \\nstrong interactions. In the 1970s came the stunning realization that the \\nsecret of all nuclear matter could be unlocked by the Yang-Mills field. \\n\\nThis was the missing piece in the puzzle. The secret of wood that \\nbound matter together was the Yang-Mills field, not the geometry of \\nEinstein. It appeared as though this, and not geometry, was the central \\nlesson of physics. \\n\\n\\nThe Standard Model \\n\\nToday, the Yang-Mills field has made possible a comprehensive theory \\nof all matter. In fact, we are so confident of this theory that we blandly \\ncall it the Standard Model. \\n\\nThe Standard Model can explain every piece of experimental data \\nconcerning subatomic particles, up to about 1 trillion electron volts in \\nenergy (the energy created by accelerating an electron by 1 trillion \\nvolts). This is about the limit of the atom smashers currently on line. \\nConsequently, it is no exaggeration to state that the Standard Model is \\nthe most successful theory in the history of science. \\n\\nAccording to the Standard Model, each of the forces binding the \\nvarious particles is created by exchanging different kinds of quanta. Let \\nus now discuss each force separately, and then assemble them into the \\nStandard Model. \\n\\nThe Strong Force \\n\\nThe Standard Model states that the protons, neutrons, and other heavy \\nparticles are not fundamental particles at all, but consist of some even \\ntinier particles, called quarks. These quarks, in turn, come in a wide \\n\\n\\n\\n122 \\n\\n\\nUNIFICATION IN TEN DIMENSIONS \\n\\n\\nvariety: three \"colors\" and six \"flavors.\" (These names have nothing to \\ndo with actual colors and flavors.) There are also the antimatter coun- \\nterparts of the quarks, called antiquarks. (Antimatter is identical to mat- \\nter in all respects, except that the charges are reversed and it annihilates \\non contact with ordinary matter.) This gives us a total of 3 X 6 X 2 = \\n36 quarks. \\n\\nThe quarks, in turn, are held together by the exchange of small pack- \\nets of energy, called gluons. Mathematically, these gluons are described \\nby the Yang-Mills field, which \"condenses\" into a sticky, taffylike sub- \\nstance that \"glues\" the quarks permanently together. The gluon field \\nis so powerful and binds the quarks so tightly together that the quarks \\ncan never be torn away from one another. This is called quark confinement, \\nand may explain why free quarks have never been seen experimentally. \\n\\nFor example, the proton and neutron can be compared to three steel \\nballs (quarks) held together by a Y-shaped string (gluon) in the shape \\nof a bola. Other strongly interacting particles, such as the pi meson, can \\nbe compared to a quark and an antiquark held together by a single string \\n(Figure 5.3). \\n\\nObviously, by kicking this arrangement of steel balls, we can set this \\ncontraption vibrating. In the quantum world, only a discrete set ofvibra- \\ntions is allowed. Each vibration of this set of steel balls or quarks corre- \\nsponds to a different type of subatomic particle. Thus this simple (but \\npowerful) picture explains the fact that there are an infinite number of \\nstrongly interacting particles. This part of the Standard Model describ- \\ning the strong force is called quantum chromodynamics (QCD) \\xe2\\x80\\x94 that \\nis, the quantum theory of the color force. \\n\\nThe Weak Force \\n\\nIn the Standard Model, the weak force governs the properties of \"lep- \\ntons,\" such as the electron, the muon, and the tau meson, and their \\nneutrino partners. Like the other forces, the leptons interact by \\nexchanging quanta, called W and Z bosons. These quanta are also \\ndescribed mathematically by the Yang-Mills field. Unlike the gluon \\nforce, the force generated by exchanging the Wand Zbosons is too weak \\nto bind the leptons into a resonance, so we do not see an infinite number \\nof leptons emerging from our atom smashers. \\n\\nThe Electromagnetic Force \\n\\nThe Standard Model includes the theory of Maxwell interacting with the \\nother particles.

Strongly interacting particles are actually composites of even smaller \\nparticles, called quarks, which are bound together by a taffylike \"glue, \" which is \\ndescribed by the Yang-Mills field. The proton and neutron are each made up of \\nthree quarks, while mesons are made up of a quark and an antiquark. \\n\\n\\n\\ntion of electrons and light is called quantum electrodynamics (QED), \\nwhich has been experimentally verified to be correct to within one part \\nin 10 million, technically making it the most accurate theory in history. \\n\\nIn sum, the fruition of 50 years of research, and several hundred million \\ndollars in government funds, has given us the following picture of sub- \\natomic matter: All matter consists of quarks and leptons, which interact by \\nexchanging different types of quanta, described by the Maxwell and Yang-Mills \\n\\n\\n\\n124 \\n\\n\\nUNIFICATION IN TEN DIMENSIONS \\n\\n\\nfields. In one sentence, we have captured the essence of the past century \\nof frustrating investigation into the subatomic realm. From this simple \\npicture one can derive, from pure mathematics alone, all the myriad \\nand baffling properties of matter. (Although it all seems so easy now, \\nNobel laureate Steven Weinberg, one of the creators of the Standard \\nModel, once reflected on how tortuous the 50-year journey to discover \\nthe model had been. He wrote, \"There\\'s a long tradition of theoretical \\nphysics, which by no means affected everyone but certainly affected me, \\nthat said the strong interactions [were] too complicated for the human \\nmind. \" 4 ) \\n\\n\\nSymmetry in Physics \\n\\nThe details of the Standard Model are actually rather boring and unim- \\nportant. The most interesting feature of the Standard Model is that it is \\nbased on symmetry. What has propelled this investigation into matter \\n(wood) is that we can see the unmistakable sign of symmetry within each \\nof these interactions. Quarks and leptons are not random, but occur in \\ndefinite patterns in the Standard Model. \\n\\nSymmetry, of course, is not strictly the province of physicists. Artists, \\nwriters, poets, and mathematicians have long admired the beauty that is \\nto be found in symmetry. To the poet William Blake, symmetry possessed \\nmystical, even fearful qualities, as expressed in the poem \"Tyger! Tyger! \\nburning bright\": \\n\\n\\nTyger! Tyger! burning bright \\nIn the forests of the night \\nWhat immortal hand or eye \\nCould frame thy fearful symmetry?\"\\xe2\\x80\\x99 \\n\\nTo mathematician Lewis Carroll, symmetry represented a familiar, \\nalmost playful concept. In the \"The Hunting of the Snark,\" he captured \\nthe essence of symmetry when he wrote: \\n\\nYou boil it in sawdust: \\n\\nYou salt it in glue: \\n\\nYou condense it with locusts in tape: \\n\\nStill keeping one principal object in view \\xe2\\x80\\x94 \\n\\nTo preserve its symmetrical shape. \\n\\n\\n\\nQuantum Heresy \\n\\n\\n125 \\n\\n\\nIn other words, symmetry is the preservation of the shape of an object \\neven after we deform or rotate it. Several kinds of symmetries occur \\nrepeatedly in nature. The first is the symmetry of rotations and reflec- \\ntions. For example, a snowflake remains the same if we rotate it by 60 \\ndegrees. The symmetry of a kaleidoscope, a flower, or a starfish is of this \\ntype. We call these space-time symmetries, which are created by rotating \\nthe object through a dimension of space or time. The symmetry of spe- \\ncial relativity is of this type, since it describes rotations between space \\nand time. \\n\\nAnother type of symmetry is created by reshuffling a series of objects. \\nThink of a shell game, where a huckster shuffles three shells with a pea \\nhidden beneath one of them. What makes the game difficult is that there \\nare many ways in which the shells can be arranged. In fact, there are six \\ndifferent ways in which three shells can be shuffled. Since the pea is \\nhidden, these six configurations are identical to the observer. Mathe- \\nmaticians like to give names to these various symmetries. The name for \\nthe symmetries of a shell game is called S\\xe2\\x80\\x9e which describes the number \\nof ways that three identical objects may be interchanged. \\n\\nIf we replace the shells with quarks, then the equations of particle \\nphysics must remain the same if we shuffle the quarks among themselves. \\nIf we shuffle three colored quarks and the equations remain the same, \\nthen we say that the equations possess something called SU(3) symmetry. \\nThe 3 represents the fact that we have three types of colors, and the SU \\nstands for a specific mathematical property of the symmetry.* We say \\nthat there are three quarks in a multiplet. The quarks in a multiplet can \\nbe shuffled among one another without changing the physics of the \\ntheory. \\n\\nSimilarly, the weak force governs the properties of two particles, the \\nelectron and the neutrino. The symmetry that interchanges these par- \\nticles, yet leaves the equation the same, is called SU(2). This means that \\na multiplet of the weak force contains an electron and a neutrino, which \\ncan be rotated into each other. Finally, the electromagnetic force has \\nU(l) symmetry, which rotates the components of the Maxwell field into \\nitself. \\n\\nEach of these symmetries is simple and elegant. However, the most \\ncontroversial aspect of the Standard Model is that it \"unifies\" the three \\nfundamental forces by simply splicing all three theories into one large \\nsymmetry, SU(3) X SU(2) X U(l), which is just the product of the \\n\\n\\n*SU stands for \"special unitary\" matrices \\xe2\\x80\\x94 that is, matrices that have unit determinant \\nand are unitary. \\n\\n\\n\\n126 \\n\\n\\nUNIFICATION IN TEN DIMENSIONS \\n\\n\\nsymmetries of the individual forces. (This can be compared to assem- \\nbling ajigsaw puzzle. If we have three jigsaw pieces that don\\'t quite fit, \\nwe can always take Scotch tape and splice them together by hand. This \\nis how the Standard Model is formed, by taping three distinct multiplets \\ntogether. This may not be aesthetically pleasing, but at least the three \\njigsaw puzzles now hang together by tape.) \\n\\nIdeally, one might have expected that \"the ultimate theory\" would \\nhave all the particles inside just a single multiplet. Unfortunately, the \\nStandard Model has three distinct multiplets, which cannot be rotated \\namong one another. \\n\\n\\nBeyond the Standard Model \\n\\nPromoters of the Standard Model can say truthfully that it fits all known \\nexperimental data. They can correctly point out that there are no exper- \\nimental results that contradict the Standard Model. Nonetheless, \\nnobody, not even its most fervent advocates, believes it is the final theory \\nof matter. There are several deep reasons why it cannot be the final \\ntheory. \\n\\nFirst, the Standard Model does not describe gravity, so it is necessarily \\nincomplete. When attempts are made to splice Einstein\\'s theory with the \\nStandard Model, the resulting theory gives nonsensical answers. When \\nwe calculate, say, the probability of an electron being deflected by a \\ngravitational field, the hybrid theory gives us an infinite probability, \\nwhich makes no sense. Physicists say that quantum gravity is nonrenor- \\nmalizable, meaning that it cannot yield sensible, finite numbers to \\ndescribe simple physical processes. \\n\\nSecond, and perhaps most important, it is very ugly because it crudely \\nsplices three very different interactions together. Personally, I think that \\nthe Standard Model can be compared to crossing three entirely dissim- \\nilar types of animals, such as a mule, an elephant, and a whale. In fact, \\nit is so ugly and contrived that even its creators are a bit embarrassed. \\nThey are the first to apologize for its shortcomings and admit that it \\ncannot be the final theory. \\n\\nThis ugliness is obvious when we write down the details of the quarks \\nand leptons. To describe how ugly the theory is, let us list the various \\nparticles and forces within the Standard Model: \\n\\n1. Thirty-six quarks, coming in six \"flavors\" and three \"colors,\" \\nand their antimatter counterparts to describe the strong inter- \\nactions \\n\\n\\n\\nQuantum Heresy \\n\\n\\n127 \\n\\n\\n2. Eight Yang-Mills fields to describe the gluons, which bind the \\nquarks \\n\\n3. Four Yang-Mills fields to describe the weak and electromagnetic \\nforces \\n\\n4. Six types of leptons to describe the weak interactions (including \\nthe electron, muon, tau lepton, and their respective neutrino \\ncounterparts) \\n\\n5. A large number of mysterious \"Higgs\" particles necessary to \\nfudge the masses and the constants describing the particles \\n\\n6. At least 19 arbitrary constants that describe the masses of the \\nparticles and the strengths of the various interactions. These 19 \\nconstants must be put in by hand; they are not determined by \\nthe theory in any way \\n\\nWorse, this long list of particles can be broken down into three \"fam- \\nilies\" of quarks and leptons, which are practically indistinguishable from \\none another. In fact, these three families of particles appear to be exact \\ncopies of one another, giving a threefold redundancy in the number of \\nsupposedly \"elementary\" particles (Figure 5.4). (It is disturbing to real- \\nize that we now have vastly more \"elementary\" particles than the total \\nnumber of subatomic particles that were discovered by the 1940s. It \\nmakes one wonder how elementary these elementary particles really \\nare.) \\n\\nThe ugliness of the Standard Model can be contrasted to the sim- \\nplicity of Einstein\\'s equations, in which everything was deduced from \\nfirst principles. To understand the aesthetic contrast between the Stan- \\ndard Model and Einstein\\'s theory of general relativity, we must realize \\nthat when physicists speak of \"beauty\" in their theories, they really mean \\nthat their theory possesses at least two essential features: \\n\\n1. A unifying symmetry \\n\\n2. The ability to explain vast amounts of experimental data with \\nthe most economical mathematical expressions \\n\\nThe Standard Model fails on both counts. Its symmetry, as we have \\nseen, is actually formed by splicing three smaller symmetries, one for \\neach of the three forces. Second, the theory is unwieldy and awkward in \\nform. It is certainly not economical by any means. For example, Ein- \\nstein\\'s equations, written out in their entirety, are only about an inch \\nlong and wouldn\\'t even fill up one line of this book. From this one line \\nof equations, we can go beyond Newton\\'s laws and derive the warping \\n\\n\\n\\n128 \\n\\n\\nUNIFICATION IN TEN DIMENSIONS \\n\\n\\nGeneration \\n\\n# 1 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nElectron \\n\\n\\n\\nNeutrino \\n\\n\\nGeneration \\n\\n# 2 \\n\\n\\nCharmed quark \\n\\n\\n\\nMuon \\n\\n\\n\\n\\'Strange quark \\n\\n\\n\\nMu-neutrino \\n\\n\\nGeneration \\n# 3 \\n\\n\\n\\nTop quark \\n\\n\\n\\nBottom quark \\n\\n\\n\\nTau \\n\\n\\n\\nT au-neutrino \\n\\n\\nFigure 5.4.

The embarrassing feature of the Standard Model is \\nthat there are three generation of such particles, each generation being nearly an \\nexact copy of the previous generation. It\\'s hard to believe that nature would be so \\nredundant as to create, at a fundamental level, three identical copies of particles. \\n\\n\\nof space, the Big Bang, and other astronomically important phenomena. \\nHowever, just to write down the Standard Model in its entirety would \\nrequire two-thirds of this page and would look like a blizzard of complex \\nsymbols. \\n\\nNature, scientists like to believe, prefers economy in its creations and \\nalways seems to avoid unnecessary redundancies in creating physical, \\n\\n\\n\\nQuantum Heresy \\n\\n\\n129 \\n\\n\\nbiological, and chemical structures. When nature creates panda bears, \\nprotein molecules, or black holes, it is sparing in its design. Or, as Nobel \\nlaureate C. N. Yang once said, \"Nature seems to take advantage of the \\nsimple mathematical representations of the symmetry laws. When one \\npauses to consider the elegance and the beautiful perfection of the \\nmathematical reasoning involved and contrast it with the complex and \\nfar-reaching physical consequences, a deep sense of respect for the \\npower of the symmetry laws never fails to develop.\"\\' However, at the \\nmost fundamental level, we now find a gross violation of this rule. The \\nexistence of three identical families, each one with an odd assortment \\nof particles, is one of the most disturbing features of the Standard Model, \\nand raises a persistent problem for physicists: Should the Standard \\nModel, the most spectacularly successful theory in the history of science, \\nbe thrown out just because it is ugly? \\n\\n\\nIs Beauty Necessary? \\n\\nI once attended a concert in Boston, where people were visibly moved \\nby the power and intensity of Beethoven\\'s Ninth Symphony. After the \\nconcert, with the rich melodies still fresh in my mind, I happened to \\nwalk past the empty orchestra pit, where I noticed some people staring \\nin wonder at the sheet music left by the musicians. \\n\\nTo the untrained eye, I thought, the musical score of even the most \\nmoving musical piece must appear to be a raw mass of unintelligible \\nsquiggles, bearing more resemblance to a chaotic jumble of scratches \\nthan a beautiful work of art. However, to the ear of a trained musician, \\nthis mass of bars, clefs, keys, sharps, flats, and notes comes alive and \\nresonates in the mind. A musician can \"hear\" beautiful harmonies and \\nrich resonances by simply looking at a musical score. A sheet of music, \\ntherefore, is more thanjust the sum of its lines. \\n\\nSimilarly, it would be a disservice to define a poem as \"a short col- \\nlection of words organized according to some principle.\" Not only is \\nthe definition sterile, but it is ultimately inaccurate because it fails to \\ntake into account the subtle interaction between the poem and the emo- \\ntions that it evokes in the reader. Poems, because they crystallize and \\nconvey the essence of the feelings and images of the author, have a \\nreality much greater than the words printed on a sheet of paper. A few \\nshort words of a haiku poem, for example, may transport the reader into \\na new realm of sensations and feelings. \\n\\n\\n\\n130 \\n\\n\\nUNIFICATION IN TEN DIMENSIONS \\n\\n\\nLike music or art, mathematical equations can have a natural pro- \\ngression and logic that can evoke rare passions in a scientist. Although \\nthe lay public considers mathematical equations to be rather opaque, to \\na scientist an equation is very much like a movement in a larger sym- \\nphony. \\n\\nSimplicity. Elegance. These are the qualities that have inspired some \\nof the greatest artists to create their masterpieces, and they are precisely \\nthe same qualities that motivate scientists to search for the laws ofnature. \\nLike a work of art or a haunting poem, equations have a beauty and \\nrhythm all their own. \\n\\nPhysicist Richard Feynman expressed this when he said, \\n\\nYou can recognize truth by its beauty and simplicity. When you get it right, \\nit is obvious that it is right \\xe2\\x80\\x94 at least if you have any experience \\xe2\\x80\\x94 because \\nusually what happens is that more comes out than goes in. . . . The inex- \\nperienced, the crackpots, and people like that, make guesses that are sim- \\nple, but you can immediately see that they are wrong, so that does not \\ncount. Others, the inexperienced students, make guesses that are very \\ncomplicated, and it sort of looks as if it is all right, but I know it is not true \\nbecause the truth always turns out to be simpler than you thought . 7 \\n\\nThe French mathematician Henri Poincare expressed it even more \\nfrankly when he wrote, \"The scientist does not study Nature because it \\nis useful; he studies it because he delights in it, and he delights in it \\nbecause it is beautiful. If Nature were not beautiful, it would not be worth \\nknowing, and if Nature were not worth knowing, life would not be worth \\nliving.\" In some sense, the equations of physics are like the poems of \\nnature. They are short and are organized according to some principle, \\nand the most beautiful of them convey the hidden symmetries ofnature. \\n\\nFor example, Maxwell\\'s equations, we recall, originally consisted of \\neight equations. These equations are not \"beautiful.\" They do not pos- \\nsess much symmetry. In their original form, they are ugly, but they are \\nthe bread and butter of every physicist or engineer who has ever earned \\na living working with radar, radio, microwaves, lasers, or plasmas. These \\neight equations are what a tort is to a lawyer or a stethoscope is to a \\ndoctor. However, when rewritten using time as the fourth dimension, \\nthis rather awkward set of eight equations collapses into a single tensor \\nequation. This is what a physicist calls \"beauty,\" because both criteria \\nare now satisfied. By increasing the number of dimensions, we reveal \\nthe true, four-dimensional symmetry of the theory and can now explain \\nvast amounts of experimental data with a single equation. \\n\\n\\n\\nQuantum Heresy \\n\\n\\n131 \\n\\n\\nAs we have repeatedly seen, the addition of higher dimensions causes \\nthe laws of nature to simplify. \\n\\nOne of the greatest mysteries confronting science today is the expla- \\nnation of the origin of these symmetries, especially in the subatomic \\nworld. When our powerful machines blow apart the nuclei of atoms by \\nslamming them with energies beyond 1 trillion electron volts, we find \\nthat the fragments can be arranged according to these symmetries. \\nSomething rare and precious is unquestionably happening when we \\nprobe down to subatomic distances. \\n\\nThe purpose of science, however, is not to marvel at the elegance of \\nnatural laws, but to explain them. The fundamental problem facing sub- \\natomic physicists is that, historically, we had no idea of why these sym- \\nmetries were emerging in our laboratories and our blackboards. \\n\\nAnd here is precisely why the Standard Model fails. No matter how \\nsuccessful the theory is, physicists universally believe that it must be \\nreplaced by a higher theory. It fails both \"tests\" for beauty. It neither \\nhas a single symmetry group nor describes the subatomic world econom- \\nically. But more important, the Standard Model does not explain where \\nthese symmetries originally came from. They arejust spliced together by \\nfiat, without any deeper understanding of their origin. \\n\\n\\nGUTS \\n\\nPhysicist Ernest Rutherford, who discovered the nucleus of the atom, \\nonce said, \"All science is either physics or stamp collecting.\"\\xe2\\x80\\x99 \\n\\nBy this, he meant that science consists of two parts. The first is phys- \\nics, which is based on the foundation of physical laws or principles. The \\nsecond is taxonomy (\"bug collecting\" or stamp collecting), which is \\ngiving erudite Greek names for objects you know almost nothing about \\nbased on superficial similarities. In this sense, the Standard Model is not \\nreal physics; it is more like stamp collecting, arranging the subatomic \\nparticles according to some superficial symmetries, but without the vagu- \\nest hint of where the symmetries come from. \\n\\nSimilarly, when Charles Darwin named his book On the Origin of Spe- \\ncies, he was going far beyond taxonomy by giving the logical explanation \\nfor the diversity of animals in nature. What is needed in physics is a \\ncounterpart of this book, to be called On the Origin of Symmetry, which \\nexplains the reasons why certain symmetries are found in nature. \\n\\nBecause the Standard Model is so contrived, over the years attempts \\nhave been made to go beyond it, with mixed success. One prominent \\n\\n\\n\\n132 \\n\\n\\nUNIFICATION IN TEN DIMENSIONS \\n\\n\\nattempt was called the Grand Unified Theory (GUT), popular in the \\nlate 1970s, which tried to unite the symmetries of the strong, weak, and \\nelectromagnetic quanta by arranging them into a much larger symmetry \\ngroup [for example, SU(5). 0(10), or E ( 6 ) ] . Instead of naively splicing \\nthe symmetry groups of the three forces, GUTs tried to start with a larger \\nsymmetry that required fewer arbitrary constants and fewer assumptions. \\nGUTs vastly increased the number of particles beyond the Standard \\nModel, but the advantage was that the ugly SU(3) X SU(2) XU(1) was \\nnow replaced by a single symmetry group. The simplest of these GUTs, \\ncalled SU (5), used 24 Yang-Mills fields, but at least all these Yang-Mills \\nfields belonged to a single symmetry, not three separate ones. \\n\\nThe aesthetic advantage of the GUTs was that they put the strongly \\ninteracting quarks and the weakly interacting leptons on the same foot- \\ning. In SU(5), for example, a multiplet of particles consisted of three \\ncolored quarks, an electron, and a neutrino. Under an SU(5) rotation, \\nthese five particles could rotate into one another without changing the \\nphysics. \\n\\nAt first, GUTs were met with intense skepticism, because the energy \\nat which the three fundamental forces were unified was around 10 15 \\nbillion electron volts, just a bit smaller than the Planck energy. This was \\nfar beyond the energy of any atom smasher on the earth, and that was \\ndiscouraging. However, physicists gradually warmed up to the idea of \\nGUTs when it was realized that they made a clear, testable prediction: \\nthe decay of the proton. \\n\\nWe recall that in the Standard Model, a symmetry like SU(3) rotates \\nthree quarks into one another; that is, a multiplet consists of three \\nquarks. This means that each of the quarks can turn into one of the \\nother quarks under certain conditions (such as the exchange of a Yang- \\nMills particle). However, quarks cannot turn into electrons. The multi- \\nplets do not mix. But in SU(5) GUT, there are five particles within a \\nmultiplet that can rotate into one another: three quarks, the electron, \\nand the neutrino. This means that one can, under certain circumstances, \\nturn a proton (made of quarks) into an electron or a neutrino. In other \\nwords, GUTs say that the proton, which was long held to be a stable \\nparticle with an infinite lifetime, is actually unstable. In principle, it also \\nmeans that all atoms in the universe will eventually disintegrate into \\nradiation.. If correct, it means that the chemical elements, which are \\ntaught in elementary chemistry classes to be stable, are actually all unsta- \\nble. \\n\\nThis doesn\\'t mean that we should expect the atoms in our body to \\ndisintegrate into a burst of radiation anytime soon. The time for the \\n\\n\\n\\nQuantum Heresy \\n\\n\\n133 \\n\\n\\nproton to decay into leptons was calculated to be on the order of 10 \\nyears, far beyond the lifetime of the universe (15 to 20 billion years). \\nAlthough this time scale was astronomically long, this didn\\'t faze the \\nexperimentalists. Since an ordinary tank of water contains an astronom- \\nical amount of protons, there is a measurable probability that some pro- \\nton within the tank will decay, even if the protons on the average decay \\non a cosmological time scale. \\n\\n\\nThe Search for Proton Decay \\n\\nWithin a few years, this abstract theoretical calculation was put to the \\ntest: Several expensive, multimillion-dollar experiments were conducted \\nby several groups of physicists around the world. The construction of \\ndetectors sensitive enough to detect proton decay involved highly expen- \\nsive and sophisticated techniques. First, experimentalists needed to con- \\nstruct enormous vats in which to detect proton decay. Then they had to \\nfill the vats with a hydrogen-rich fluid (such as water or cleaning fluid) \\nthat had been filtered with special techniques in order to eliminate all \\nimpurities and contaminants. Most important, they then had to bury \\nthese gigantic tanks deep in the earth to eliminate any contamination \\nfrom highly penetrating cosmic rays. And finally, they had to construct \\nthousands of highly sensitive detectors to record the faint tracks of sub- \\natomic particles emitted from proton decay. \\n\\nRemarkably, by the late 1980s six gigantic detectors were in operation \\naround the world, such as the Kamioka detector in Japan and the 1MB \\n(Irvine, Michigan, Brookhaven) detector near Cleveland, Ohio. They \\ncontained vast amounts of pure fluid (such as water) ranging in weight \\nfrom 60 to 3,300 tons. (The 1MB detector, for example, is the world\\'s \\nlargest and is contained in a huge 20-meter cube hollowed out of a salt \\nmine underneath Lake Erie. Any proton that spontaneously decayed in \\nthe purified water would produce a microscopic burst of light, which in \\nturn would be picked up by some of the 2,048 photoelectric tubes.) \\n\\nTo understand how these monstrous detectors can measure the pro- \\nton lifetime, by analogy think of the American population. We know that \\nthe average American can expect to live on the order of 70 years. How- \\never, we don\\'t have to wait 70 years to find fatalities. Because there are \\nso many Americans, in fact more than 250 million, we expect to find \\nsome American dying every few minutes. Likewise, the simplest SU(5) \\nGUT predicted that the half-life of the proton should be about 10\" years; \\nthat is, after 10\" years, half of the protons in the universe will have \\n\\n\\n\\n134 \\n\\n\\nUNIFICATION IN TEN DIMENSIONS \\n\\n\\ndecayed.* (By contrast, this is about 10 billion billion times longer than \\nthe life of the universe itself.) Although this seems like an enormous \\nlifetime, these detectors should have been able to see these rare, fleeting \\nevents simply because there were so many protons in the detector. In \\nfact, each ton of water contains over 10 ! \" protons. With that many pro- \\ntons, a handful of protons were expected to decay every year. \\n\\nHowever, no matter how long the experimentalists waited, they saw \\nno clear-cut evidence of any proton decays. At present, it seems that \\nprotons must have a lifetime larger than 10\\xe2\\x80\\x9d years, which rules out the \\nsimpler GUTs, but still leaves open the possibility of more complicated \\nGUTs. \\n\\nInitially, a certain amount of excitement over the GUTs spilled over \\ninto the media. The quest for a unified theory of matter and the search \\nfor the decay of the proton caught the attention of science producers \\nand writers. Public television\\'s \"Nova\" devoted several shows to it, and \\npopular books and numerous articles in science magazines were written \\nabout it. Nevertheless, the fanfare died out by the late 1980s. No matter \\nhow long physicists waited for the proton to decay, the proton simply \\ndidn\\'t cooperate. After tens of millions of dollars were spent by various \\nnations looking for this event, it has not yet been found. Public interest \\nin the GUTs began to fizzle. \\n\\nThe proton may still decay, and GUTs may still prove to be correct, \\nbut physicists are now much more cautious about touting the GUTs as \\nthe \"final theory,\" for several reasons. As with the Standard Model, \\nGUTs make no mention of gravity. If we naively combine GUTs with \\ngravity, the theory produces numbers that are infinite and hence make \\nno sense. Like the Standard Model, GUTs are nonrenormalizable. More- \\nover, the theory is defined at tremendous energies, where we certainly \\nexpected gravitational effects to appear. Thus the fact that gravity is \\nmissing in the GUT theory is a serious drawback. Furthermore, it is also \\nplagued by the mysterious presence of three identical carbon copies or \\nfamilies of particles. And finally, the theory could not predict the fun- \\ndamental constants, such as the quark masses. GUTs lacked a larger \\nphysical principle that would fix the quark masses and the other con- \\nstants from first principles. Ultimately, it appeared that GUTs were also \\nstamp collecting. \\n\\nThe fundamental problem was that the Yang-Mills field was not suf- \\n\\n* Half-life is the amount of time it takes for half of a substance to disintegrate. After two \\nhalf-lives, only one-quarter of the substance remains. \\n\\n\\n\\nQuantum Heresy \\n\\n\\n135 \\n\\n\\nficient to provide the \"glue\" to unite all four interactions. The world of \\nwood, as described by the Yang-Mills field, was not powerful enough to \\nexplain the world of marble. \\n\\nAfter half a century of dormancy, the time had come for \"Einstein\\'s \\nrevenge.\" \\n\\n\\n\\n6 \\n\\nEinstein\\'s Revenge \\n\\n\\nSupersymmetry is the ultimate proposal for a complete unifi- \\ncation of all particles. \\n\\nAbdus Salam \\n\\n\\nThe Resurrection of Kaluza-Klein \\n\\n\\nI T\\'S been called \"the greatest scientific problem of all time.\" The \\npress has dubbed it the \"Holy Grail\" of physics, the quest to unite \\nthe quantum theory with gravity, thereby creating a Theory of Every- \\nthing. This is the problem that has frustrated the finest minds of the \\ntwentieth century. Without question, the person who solves this problem \\nwill win the Nobel Prize. \\n\\nBy the 1980s, physics was reaching an impasse. Gravity alone stub- \\nbornly stood apart and aloof from the other three forces. Ironically, \\nalthough the classical theory of gravity was the first to be understood \\nthrough the work of Newton, the quantum theory of gravity was the last \\ninteraction to be understood by physicists. \\n\\nAll the giants of physics have had their crack at this problem, and all \\nhave failed. Einstein devoted the last 30 years of his life to his unified \\nfield theory. Even the great Werner Heisenberg, one of the founders of \\nquantum theory, spent the last years of his life chasing after his version \\nof a unified theory of fields, even publishing a book on the subject. In \\n1958. Heisenberg even broadcast on radio that he and his colleague \\n\\n\\n136 \\n\\n\\n\\nEinstein \\'s Revenge \\n\\n\\n37 \\n\\n\\nWolfgang Pauli had finally succeeded in finding the unified field theory, \\nand that only the technical details were missing. (When the press got \\nwind of this stunning declaration. Pauli was furious that Heisenberg had \\nprematurely made that announcement. Pauli send a letter to his collab- \\norator, consisting of a blank sheet of paper with the caption, \"This is to \\nshow the world that I can paint like Titian. Only technical details are \\nmissing.\" 1 ) \\n\\nLater that year, when Wolfgang Pauli finally gave a lecture on the \\nHeisenberg-Pauli unified field theory, many eager physicists were in the \\naudience, anxious to hear the missing details. When he was finished, \\nhowever, the talk received a mixed response. Niels Bohr finally stood up \\nand said, \"We are all agreed that your theory is crazy. The question \\nwhich divides us iswhetheritis crazy enough . In fact, so many attempts \\nhave been made at the \"final synthesis\" that it has created a backlash \\nof skepticism. Nobel laureate Julian Schwinger has said, \"It\\'s nothing \\nmore than another symptom of the urge that afflicts every generation \\nof physicist \\xe2\\x80\\x94 the itch to have all the fundamental questions answered in \\ntheir own lifetimes.\"\\xe2\\x80\\x99 \\n\\nHowever, by the 1980s, the \"quantum theory of wood,\" after a half- \\ncentury of almost uninterrupted success, was beginning to run out of \\nsteam. I can vividly remember the sense of frustration among jaded \\nyoung physicists during this period. Everyone sensed that the Standard \\nModel was being killed by its own success. It was so successful that every \\ninternational physics conference seemed likejust another rubber stamp \\nof approval. All the talks concerned finding yet another boring experi- \\nmental success for the Standard Model. At one physics conference, I \\nglanced back at the audience and found that half of them were slowly \\ndozing off to sleep; the speaker was droning on with chart after chart \\nshowing how the latest data could be fit according to the Standard \\nModel. \\n\\nI felt like the physicists at the turn of the century. They, too, seemed \\nto be facing a dead end. They spent decades tediously filling up tables \\nof figures for the spectral lines of various gases, or calculating the solu- \\ntions to Maxwell\\'s equations for increasingly complicated metal surfaces. \\nSince the Standard Model had 19 free parameters that could be arbi- \\ntrarily \"tuned\" to any value, like the dials on a radio, I imagined that \\nphysicists would spend decades finding the precise values of all 19 \\nparameters. \\n\\nThe time had come for a revolution. What beckoned the next gen- \\neration of physicists was the world of marble. \\n\\nOf course, several profound problems stood in the way of a genuine \\n\\n\\n\\n38 \\n\\n\\nUNIFICATION IN TEN DIMENSIONS \\n\\n\\nquantum theory of gravity. One problem with constructing a theory of \\ngravity is that the force is so maddeningly weak. For example, it takes \\nthe entire mass of the earth to keep pieces of paper on my desk. How- \\never, by brushing a comb through my hair, I can pick up these pieces of \\npaper, overwhelming the force of the planet earth. The electrons in my \\ncomb are more powerful than the gravitational pull of the entire planet. \\nSimilarly, if I were to try to construct an \"atom\" with electrons attracted \\nto the nucleus by the gravitational force, and not the electrical force, \\nthe atom would be the size of the universe. \\n\\nClassically, we see that the gravitational force is negligible compared \\nwith the electromagnetic force, and hence is extraordinarily difficult to \\nmeasure. But if we attempt to write down a quantum theory of gravity, \\nthen the tables are turned. The quantum corrections due to gravity are \\non the order of the Planck energy, or 10\\'\" billion electron volts, far \\nbeyond anything achievable on the planet earth in this century. This \\nperplexing situation deepens when we try to construct a complete theory \\nof quantum gravity. We recall that when quantum physicists try to quan- \\ntize a force, they break it up into tiny packets of energy, called quanta. \\nIf you blindly try to quantize the theory of gravity, you postulate that it \\nfunctions by the exchange of tiny packets of gravity, called gravitons. The \\nrapid exchange of gravitons between matter is what binds them together \\ngravitationally. In this picture, what holds us to the floor, and keeps us \\nfrom flying into outer space at a thousand miles per hour, is the invisible \\nexchange of trillions of tiny graviton particles. But whenever physicists \\ntried to perform simple calculations to calculate quantum corrections \\nto Newton\\'s and Einstein\\'s laws of gravity, they found that the result is \\ninfinite, which is useless. \\n\\nFor example, let us examine what happens when two electrically neu- \\ntral particles bump into each other. To calculate the Feynman diagrams \\nfor this theory, we have to make an approximation, so we assume that \\nthe curvature of space-time is small, and hence the Riemann metric \\ntensor is close to 1. For a first guess, we assume that space-time is close \\nto being flat, not curved, so we divide the components of the metric \\ntensor as g n = 1 + h\\xe2\\x80\\x9e, where 1 represents flat space in our equations \\nand h,, is the graviton field. (Einstein, of course, was horrified that quan- \\ntum physicists would mutilate his equations in this way by breaking up \\nthe metric tensor. This is like taking a beautiful piece of marble and \\nhitting it with a sledge hammer in order to break it.) After this mutilation \\nis performed, we arrive at a conventional-looking quantum theory. In \\nFigure 6.1 (a), we see that the two neutral particles exchange a quantum \\nof gravity, labeled by the field h. \\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 6.1. (a) In quantum theory, a quantum of the gravitational force, labeled \\nh, is called the graviton, which is formed by breaking up Riemann \\'s metric. In \\nthis theory, objects interact by exchanging this packet of gravity. In this way, we \\ncompletely lose the beautiful geometric picture of Einstein, ( b ) Unfortunately, all \\nthe diagrams with loops in them are infinite, which has prevented a unification \\nof gravity with the quantum theory for the past half-century. A quantum theory \\nof gravity that unites it with the other forces is the Holy Grail of physics. \\n\\n\\n139 \\n\\n\\n\\n140 \\n\\n\\nUNIFICATION IN TEN DIMENSIONS \\n\\n\\nThe problem arises when we sum over all loop diagrams: We find \\nthat they diverge, as in Figure 6.1 (b). For the Yang-Mills field, we could \\nuse clever sleight-of-hand tricks to shuffle around these infinite quanti- \\nties until they either cancel or are absorbed into quantities that can\\'t be \\nmeasured. However, it can be shown that the usual renormalization pre- \\nscriptions fail completely when we apply them to a quantum theory of \\ngravity. In fact, the efforts of physicists over half a century to eliminate \\nor absorb these infinities has been in vain. In other words, the brute- \\nforce attempt to smash marble into pieces failed miserably. \\n\\nThen, in the early 1980s, a curious phenomenon occurred. Kaluza- \\nKlein theory, we recall, had been a dormant theory for 60 years. But \\nphysicists were so frustrated in their attempts to unify gravity with the \\nother quantum forces that they began to overcome their prejudice about \\nunseen dimensions and hyperspace. They were ready for an alternative, \\nand that was Kaluza-Klein theory. \\n\\nThe late physicist Heinz Pagels summarized this excitement over the \\nre-emergence of Kaluza-Klein theory: \\n\\n\\nAfter the 1930s, the Kaluza-Klein idea fell out offavor, and for many years \\nit lay dormant. But recently, as physicists searched out every possible ave- \\nnue for the unification of gravity with other forces, it has again sprung to \\nprominence. Today, in contrast with the 1920s, physicists are challenged \\nto do more than unify gravity with just electromagnetism \\xe2\\x80\\x94 they want to \\nunify gravity with the weak and strong interactions as well. This requires \\neven more dimensions, beyond the fifth. 1 \\n\\nEven Nobel laureate Steven Weinberg was swept up by the enthusi- \\nasm generated by Kaluza-Klein theory. However, there were still physi- \\ncists skeptical of the Kaluza-Klein renaissance. Harvard\\'s Howard \\nGeorgi, reminding Weinberg how difficult it is to measure experimen- \\ntally these compactified dimensions that have curled up, composed the \\nfollowing poem: \\n\\n\\nSteve Weinberg, returning from Texas \\nbrings dimensions galore to perplex us \\nBut the extra ones all \\nare rolled up in a ball \\nso tiny it never affects us. 5 \\n\\nAlthough Kaluza-Klein theory was still nonrenormalizable, what \\nsparked the intense interest in the theory was that it gave the hope of a \\n\\n\\n\\nEinstein \\'s Revenge \\n\\n\\n141 \\n\\n\\ntheory made of marble. Turning the ugly, confused jumble of wood into \\nthe pure, elegant marble of geometry was, of course, Einstein\\'s dream. \\nBut in the 1930s and 1940s, almost nothing was known about the nature \\nof wood. However, by the 1970s, the Standard Model had finally \\nunlocked the secret of wood: that matter consists of quarks and leptons \\nheld together by the Yang-Mills field, obeying the symmetry SU(3) X \\nSU(2) X U(l). The problem was how to derive these particles and mys- \\nterious symmetries from marble. \\n\\nAt first, that seemed impossible. After all, these symmetries are the \\nresult of interchanging point particles among one another. If A quarks \\nwithin a multiplet are shuffled among one another, then the symmetry \\nis SU(N). These symmetries seemed to be exclusively the symmetries of \\nwood, not marble. What did SU(N) have to do with geometry? \\n\\n\\nTurning Wood into Marble \\n\\nThe first small clue came in the 1960s, when physicists found, much to \\ntheir delight, that there is an alternative way in which to introduce sym- \\nmetries into physics. When physicists extended the old five-dimensional \\ntheory of Kaluza-Klein to A dimensions, they realized that there is the \\nfreedom to impose a symmetry on hyperspace. When the fifth dimension \\nwas curled up, they saw that the Maxwell field popped out of Riemann\\'s \\nmetric. But when A dimensions were curled up, physicists found the \\ncelebrated Yang-Mills field, the key to the Standard Model, popping out \\nof their equations! \\n\\nTo see how symmetries emerge from space, consider an ordinary \\nbeach ball. It has a symmetry: We can rotate it around its center, and \\nthe beach ball retains its shape. The symmetry of a beach ball, or a \\nsphere, is called 0(3), or rotations in three dimension. Similarly, in \\nhigher dimensions, a hypersphere can also be rotated around its center \\nand maintain its shape. The hypersphere has a symmetry called O(A). \\n\\nNow consider vibrating the beach ball. Ripples form on the surface \\nof the ball. If we carefully vibrate the beach ball in a certain way, we can \\ninduce regular vibrations on it that are called resonances. These reso- \\nnances, unlike ordinary ripples, can vibrate at only certain frequencies. \\nIn fact, if we vibrate the beach ball fast enough, we can create musical \\ntones of a definite frequency. These vibrations, in turn, can be cataloged \\nby the symmetry 0(3). \\n\\nThe fact that a membrane, like a beach ball, can induce resonance \\nfrequencies is a common phenomenon. The vocal chords in our throat, \\n\\n\\n\\n142 \\n\\n\\nUNIFICATION IN TEN DIMENSIONS \\n\\n\\nfor example, are stretched membranes that vibrate at definite frequen- \\ncies, or resonances, and can thereby produce musical tones. Another \\nexample is our hearing. Sound waves of all types impinge on our ear- \\ndrums, which then resonate at definite frequencies. These vibrations are \\nthen turned into electrical signals that are sent into our brain, which \\ninterprets them as sounds. This is also the principle behind the tele- \\nphone. The metallic diaphragm contained in any telephone is set into \\nmotion by electrical signals in the telephone wire. This creates mechan- \\nical vibrations or resonances in the diaphragm, which in turn create the \\nsound waves we hear on the phone. This is also the principle behind \\nstereo speakers as well as orchestral drums. \\n\\nFor a hypersphere, the effect is the same. Like a membrane, it can \\nresonate at various frequencies, which in turn can be determined by its \\nsymmetry O(N). Alternatively, mathematicians have dreamed up more \\nsophisticated surfaces in higher dimensions that are described by com- \\nplex numbers. (Complex numbers use the square root of \\xe2\\x80\\x94 1, \\' \\xe2\\x80\\x94 1.) \\nThen it is straightforward to show that the symmetry corresponding to \\na complex \"hypersphere\" is SU(N). \\n\\nThe key point is now this: If the wave function of a particle vibrates \\nalong this surface, it will inherit this SU(N) symmetry. Thus the myste- \\nrious SU(N) symmetries arising in subatomic physics can now be seen \\nas by-products of vibrating hyperspace! In other words, we now have an expla- \\nnation for the origin of the mysterious symmetries of wood: They are \\nreally the hidden symmetries coming from marble. \\n\\nIf we now take a Kaluza-Klein theory defined in 4 + IV dimensions \\nand then curl up N dimensions, we will find that the equations split into \\ntwo pieces. The first piece is Einstein\\'s usual equations, which we retrieve \\nas expected. But the second piece will not be the theory of Maxwell. We \\nfind that the remainder is precisely the Yang-Mills theory, which forms \\nthe basis of all subatomic physics! This is the key to turning the sym- \\nmetries of wood into the symmetries of marble. \\n\\nAt first, it seems almost mystical that the symmetries of wood, which \\nwere discovered painfully by trial and error \\xe2\\x80\\x94 that is, by painstakingly \\nexamining the debris from atom smashers \\xe2\\x80\\x94 emerge almost automati- \\ncally from higher dimensions. It is miraculous that the symmetries found \\nby shuffling quarks and leptons among themselves should arise from \\nhyperspace. An analogy may help us understand this. Matter may be \\nlikened to clay, which is formless and lumpy. Clay lacks any of the beau- \\ntiful symmetries that are inherent in geometric figures. However, clay \\nmay be pressed into a mold, which can have symmetries. For example, \\nthe mold may preserve its shape if it is rotated by a certain angle. Then \\n\\n\\n\\nEinstein \\'s Revenge \\n\\n\\n143 \\n\\n\\nthe clay will also inherit the symmetry of the mold. Clay, like matter, \\ninherits its symmetry because the mold, like space-time, has a symmetry. \\n\\nIf correct, then this means that the strange symmetries we see among \\nthe quarks and leptons, which were discovered largely by accident over \\nseveral decades, can now be seen as by-products of vibrations in hyper- \\nspace. For example, if the unseen dimensions have the symmetry SU(5 ), \\nthen we can write SU(5) GUT as a Kaluza-Klein theory. \\n\\nThis can also be seen from Riemann\\'s metric tensor. We recall that \\nit resembles Faraday\\'s field except that it has many more components. \\nIt can be arranged like the squares of a checkerboard. By separating out \\nthe fifth column and row of the checkerboard, we can split off Maxwell\\'s \\nfield from Einstein\\'s field. Now perform the same trick with Kaluza- \\nKlein theory in (4 + N)-dimensional space. If you split off the N columns \\nand rows from the first four columns and rows, then you obtain a metric \\ntensor that describes both Einstein\\'s theory and Yang-Mills theory. In \\nFigure 6.2, we have carved up the metric tensor of a (4 + N)-dimensional \\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 6.2. If we go to the Nth dimension, then the metric tensor is a series of \\nN ! numbers that can be arranged in an N X N block. By slicing off the fifth \\nand higher columns and rows, we can extract the Maxwell electromagnetic field \\nand the Yang-Mills field. Thus, in one stroke, the hyperspace theory allows us to \\nunify the Einstein field ( describing gravity ), the Maxwell field ( describing the \\nelectromagnetic force), and the Yang-Mills field (describing the weak and strong \\nforce). The fundamental forces fit together exactly like a jigsaw puzzle. \\n\\n\\n\\n144 \\n\\n\\nUNIFICATION IN TEN DIMENSIONS \\n\\n\\nKaluza-Klein theory, splitting off Einstein\\'s field from the Yang-Mills \\nfield. \\n\\nApparently, one of the first physicists to perform this reduction was \\nUniversity of Texas physicist Bryce DeWitt, who has spent many years \\nstudying quantum gravity. Once this trick of splitting up the metric ten- \\nsor was discovered, the calculation for extracting the Yang-Mills field is \\nstraightforward. DeWitt felt that extracting the Yang-Mills field from N- \\ndimensional gravity theory was such a simple mathematical exercise that \\nhe assigned it as a homework problem at the Les Houches Physics Sum- \\nmer School in France in 1963. [Recently, it was revealed by Peter Freund \\nthat Oskar Klein had independently discovered the Yang-Mills field in \\n1938, preceding the work ofYang, Mills, and others by several decades. \\nIn a conference held in Warsaw titled \"New Physical Theories,\" Klein \\nannounced that he was able to generalize the work of Maxwell to include \\na higher symmetry, 0(3). Unfortunately, because of the chaos unleashed \\nby World War II and because Kaluza-Klein theory was buried by the \\nexcitement generated by quantum theory, this important work was for- \\ngotten. It is ironic that Kaluza-Klein theory was killed by the emergence \\nof quantum theory, which is now based on the Yang-Mills field, which \\nwas first discovered by analyzing Kaluza-Klein theory. In the excitement \\nto develop quantum theory, physicists had ignored a central discovery \\ncoming from Kaluza-Klein theory.] \\n\\nExtracting the Yang-Mills field out of Kaluza-Klein theory was only \\nthe first step. Although the symmetries of wood could now be seen as \\narising from the hidden symmetries of unseen dimensions, the next step \\nwas to create wood itself (made of quarks and leptons) entirely out of \\nmarble. This next step would be called supergravity. \\n\\n\\nSupergravity \\n\\nTurning wood into marble still faced formidable problems because, \\naccording to the Standard Model, all particles are \"spinning.\" Wood, \\nfor example, we now know is made of quarks and leptons. They, in turn, \\nhave 1/2 unit of quantum spin (measured in units of PI anck\\'s const an th-bar. \\nParticles with half-integral spin (1/2, 3/2, 5/2, and so on) are called fermions \\n(named after Enrico Fermi, who first investigated their strange proper- \\nties). However, forces are described by quanta with integral spin. For \\nexample, the photon, the quantum oflight, has one unit of spin. So does \\nthe Yang-Mills field. The graviton, the hypothetical packet of gravity, \\nhas two units of spin. They are called bosons (after the Indian physicist \\nSatyendra Bose). \\n\\n\\n\\nEinstein \\'s Revenge \\n\\n\\n145 \\n\\n\\nTraditionally, quantum theory kept fermions and bosons strictly \\napart. Indeed, any attempt to turn wood into marble would inevitably \\ncome to grips with the fact that fermions and bosons are worlds apart \\nin their properties. For example, SU(N) may shuffle quarks among one \\nanother, but fermions and bosons were never supposed to mix. It came \\nas a shock, therefore, when a new symmetry, called supersymmetry, was \\ndiscovered, that did exactly that. Equations that are supersymmetric \\nallow the interchange of a fermion with a boson and still keep the equa- \\ntions intact. In other words, one multiplet of supersymmetry consists of \\nequal numbers of bosons and fermions. By shuffling the bosons and \\nfermions within the same multiplet, the supersymmetric equations \\nremain the same. \\n\\nThis gives us the tantalizing possibility of putting all the particles in \\nthe universe into one multiplet! As Nobel laureate Abdus Salam has \\nemphasized, \"Supersymmetry is the ultimate proposal for a complete \\nunification of all particles.\" \\n\\nSupersymmetry is based on a new kind of number system that would \\ndrive any schoolteacher insane. Most of the operations of multiplication \\nand division that we take for granted fail for supersymmetry. For exam- \\nple, if a and b are two \"super numbers,\" then a X b = \\xe2\\x80\\x94 b X a. This, of \\ncourse, is strictly impossible for ordinary numbers. Normally, any school- \\nteacher would throw these super numbers out the window, because you \\ncan show that a X a = \\xe2\\x80\\x94 a X a, or, in other words, a X a = 0. If these \\nwere ordinary numbers, then this means that a = 0, and the number \\nsystem collapses. However, with super numbers, the system does not col- \\nlapse; we have the rather astonishing statement that a X a = 0 even \\nwhen a =/ 0. Although these super numbers violate almost everything \\nwe have learned about numbers since childhood, they can be shown to \\nyield a self-consistent and highly nontrivial system. Remarkably, an \\nentirely new system of super calculus can be based on them. \\n\\nSoon, three physicists (Daniel Freedman, Sergio Ferrara, and Peter \\nvan Nieuwenhuizen, at the State University of New York at Stony Brook) \\nwrote down the theory of supergravity in 1976. Supergravity was the first \\nrealistic attempt to construct a world made entirely of marble. In a super- \\nsymmetric theory, all particles have super partners, called sparticles. The \\nsupergravity theory of the Stony Brook group contains just two fields: \\nthe spin-two graviton field (which is a boson) and its spin-3/2 partner, \\ncalled the gravitino (which means \"little gravity\"). Since this is not \\nenough particles to include the Standard Model, attempts were made to \\ncouple the theory to more complicated particles. \\n\\nThe simplest way to include matter is to write down the supergravity \\ntheory in 1 1 -dimensional space. In order to write down the super \\n\\n\\n\\n146 \\n\\n\\nUNIFICATION IN TEN DIMENSIONS \\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 6.3. Supergravity almost fulfills Einstein\\'s dream of giving a purely geo- \\nmetric derivation of all the forces and particles in the universe. To see this, notice \\nthat if we add supersymmetry to the Riemann metric tensor, the metric doubles in \\nsize, giving us the super Riemann metric. The new components of the super Rie- \\nmann tensor correspond to quarks and leptons. By slicing the super Riemann \\ntensor into its components, we find that it includes almost all the fundamental \\nparticles and forces in nature: Einstein \\'s theory of gravity, the Yang-Mills and \\nMaxwell fields, and the quarks and leptons. But the fact that certain particles \\nare missing in this picture forces us to go a more powerful formalism: superstring \\n\\n\\nKaluza-Klein theory in 1 1 dimensions, one has to increase the compo- \\nnents within the Riemann tensor vastly, which now becomes the super \\nRiemann tensor. To visualize how supergravity converts wood into mar- \\nble, let us write down the metric tensor and show how supergravity man- \\nages to fit the Einstein field, the Yang-Mills field, and the matter fields \\ninto one supergravity field (Figure 6.3). The essential feature of this \\ndiagram is that matter, along with the Yang-Mills and Einstein equa- \\ntions, is now included in the same 1 1 -dimensional supergravity field. \\nSupersymmetry is the symmetry that reshuffles the wood into marble \\nand vice versa within the supergravity field. Thus they are all manifes- \\ntations of the same force, the superforce. Wood no longer exists as a \\nsingle, isolated entity. It is now merged with marble, to form supermar- \\nble (Figure 6.4)! \\n\\n\\n\\nEinstein \\'s Revenge \\n\\n\\n147 \\n\\n\\nPhysicist Peter van Nieuwenhuizen, one of supergravity\\'s creators, \\nwas deeply impressed by the implication of this superunification. He \\nwrote that supergravity \"may unify grand unified theories . . . with grav- \\nity, leading to a model with almost no free parameters. It is the unique \\ntheory with a local gauge symmetry between fermions and bosons. It is \\nthe most beautiful gauge theory known, so beautiful, in fact, that Nature \\nshould be aware of it!\" 6 \\n\\nI fondly remember attending and giving lectures at many of these \\nsupergravity conferences. There was an intense, exhilarating feeling that \\nwe were on the verge of something important. At one meeting in Mos- \\ncow, I remember well, a series of lively toasts were made to the continued \\nsuccess of the supergravity theory. It seemed that we were finally on the \\nverge of carrying out Einstein\\'s dream of a universe of marble after 60 \\nyears of neglect. Some of usjokingly called it \"Einstein\\'s revenge.\" \\n\\nOn April 29, 1980, when cosmologist Stephen Hawking assumed the \\nLucasian Professorship (previously held by some of the immortals of \\nphysics, including Isaac Newton and P. A. M. Dirac), he gave a lecture \\nwith the auspicious title \"Is the End in Sight for Theoretical Physics?\" \\n\\n\\n! \\n\\nGravity \\n\\nL \\n\\ni \\n\\ng \\n\\nh \\n\\nt \\n\\nNuclear \\n\\nForce \\n\\n\\nLight \\n\\n\\n\\nMatter \\n\\nNuclear \\n\\nForce \\n\\n\\n\\nMatter \\n\\nV \\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 6.4. In supergravity, we almost get a unification of all the known forces \\n(marble) with matter (wood). Like a jigsaw puzzle, they fit inside Riemann\\'s metric \\ntensor. This almost fulfills Einstein\\'s dream. \\n\\n\\n148 \\n\\n\\nUNIFICATION IN TEN DIMENSIONS \\n\\n\\nA student read for him: \"[W]e have made a lot of progress in recent \\nyears and, as I shall describe, there are some grounds for cautious opti- \\nmism that we may see a complete theory within the lifetime of some of \\nthose present here.\" \\n\\nSupergravity\\'s fame gradually spread into the general public and \\neven began to have a following among religious groups. For example, \\nthe concept of \"unification\" is a central beliefwithin the transcendental \\nmeditation movement. Its followers therefore published a large poster \\ncontaining the complete equations describing 1 1 -dimensional super- \\ngravity. Each term in the equation, they claimed, represented something \\nspecial, such as \"harmony,\" \"love,\" \"brotherhood,\" and so on. (This \\nposter hangs on the wall of the theoretical institute at Stony Brook. This \\nis the first time that I am aware of that an abstract equation from theo- \\nretical physics has inspired a following among a religious group!) \\n\\n\\nSuper Metric Tensors \\n\\nPeter van Nieuwenhuizen cuts a rather dashing figure in physics circles. \\nTall, tanned, athletic looking, and well dressed, he looks more like an \\nactor promoting suntan lotion on television than one of the original \\ncreators of supergravity. He is a Dutch physicist who is now a professor \\nat Stony Brook; he was a student ofVeltman, as was \\'t Hooft, and was \\ntherefore long interested in the question of unification. He is one of the \\nfew physicists I have ever met with a truly inexhaustible capacity for \\nmathematical punishment. Working with supergravity requires an \\nextraordinary amount of patience. We recall that the simple metric ten- \\nsor introduced by Riemann in the nineteenth century had only ten com- \\nponents. Riemann\\'s metric tensor has now been replaced by the super \\nmetric tensor of supergravity, which has literally hundreds of compo- \\nnents. This is not surprising, since any theory that has higher dimensions \\nand makes the claim of unifying all matter has to have enough compo- \\nnents to describe it, but this vastly increases the mathematical complexity \\nof the equations. (Sometimes I wonder what Riemann would think, \\nknowing that after a century his metric tensor would blossom into a \\nsuper metric many times larger than anything a nineteenth-century \\nmathematician could conceive.) \\n\\nThe coming of supergravity and super metric tensors has meant that \\nthe amount of mathematics a graduate student must master has \\nexploded within the past decade. As Steven Weinberg observes, \"Look \\nwhat\\'s happened with supergravity. The people who\\'ve been working on \\n\\n\\n\\nEinstein \\'s Revenge \\n\\n\\n149 \\n\\n\\nit for the past ten years are enormously bright. Some of them are \\nbrighter than anyone I knew in my early years.\"\\' \\n\\nPeter is not only a superb calculator, but also a trendsetter. Because \\ncalculations for a single supergravity equation can easily exceed a sheet \\nof paper, he eventually started using large, oversize artist\\'s sketch boards. \\nI went to his house one day, and saw how he operated. He would start \\nat the upper4eft-hand corner of the pad, and start writing his equations \\nin his microscopic handwriting. He would then proceed to work across \\nand down the sketch pad until it was completely filled, and then turn \\nthe page and start again. This process would then go on for hours, until \\nthe calculation was completed. The only time he would ever be inter- \\nrupted was when he inserted his pencil into a nearby electric pencil \\nsharpener, and then within seconds he would resume his calculation \\nwithout missing a symbol. Eventually, he would store these artist\\'s note- \\npads on his shelf, as though they were volumes of some scientific journal. \\nPeter\\'s sketch pads gradually became notorious around campus. Soon, \\na fad started; all the graduate students in physics began to buy these \\nbulky artist\\'s sketch pads and could be seen on campus hauling them \\nawkwardly but proudly under their arms. \\n\\nOne time, Peter, his friend Paul Townsend (now at Cambridge Uni- \\nversity), and I were collaborating on an exceptionally difficult super- \\ngravity problem. The calculation was so difficult that it consumed several \\nhundred pages. Since none of us totally trusted our calculations, we \\ndecided to meet in my dining room and collectively check our work. We \\nfaced a daunting challenge: Several thousand terms had to sum up to \\nexactly zero. (Usually, we theoretical physicists can \"visualize\" blocks of \\nequations in our heads and manipulate them without having to use \\npaper. However, because of the sheer length and delicacy of this prob- \\nlem, we had to check every single minus sign in the calculation.) \\n\\nWe then divided the problem into several large chunks. Sitting \\naround the dining-room table, each of us would busily calculate the same \\nchunk. After an hour or so, we would then cross-check our results. Usu- \\nally two out of three would get it right, and the third would be asked to \\nfind his mistake. Then we would go to the next chunk, and repeat the \\nsame process until all three of us agreed on the same answer. This repet- \\nitive cross-checking went on late into the night. We knew that even one \\nmistake in several hundred pages would give us a totally worthless cal- \\nculation. Finally, well past midnight we checked the last and final term. \\nIt was zero, as we had hoped. We then toasted our result. (The arduous \\ncalculation must have exhausted even an indefatigable workhorse like \\nPeter. After leaving my apartment, he promptly forgot where his wife\\'s \\n\\n\\n\\n150 \\n\\n\\nUNIFICATION IN TEN DIMENSIONS \\n\\n\\nnew apartment was in Manhattan. He knocked on several doors of an \\napartment house, but got only angry responses; he had chosen the wrong \\nbuilding. After a futile search, Peter and Paul reluctantly headed back \\nto Stony Brook. But because Peter had forgotten to replace a clutch \\ncable, the cable snapped, and they had to push his car. They eventually \\nstraggled into Stony Brook in their broken car at 5:00 in the morning!) \\n\\n\\nThe Decline of Supergravity \\n\\nThe critics, however, gradually began to see problems with supergravity. \\nAfter an intensive search, sparticles were not seen in any experiment. \\nFor example, the spin-1/2 electron does not have any spin-0 partner. In \\nfact, there is, at the present, not one shred of experimental evidence for \\nsparticles in our low-energy world. However, the firm belief of physicists \\nworking in this area is that, at the enormous energies found at the instant \\nof Creation, all particles were accompanied by their super partners. Only \\nat this incredible energy do we see a perfectly supersymmetric world. \\n\\nBut after a few years of fervent interest and scores of international \\nconferences, it became clear that this theory could not be quantized \\ncorrectly, thus temporarily derailing the dream of creating a theory \\npurely out of marble. Like every other attempt to construct a theory of \\nmatter entirely from marble, supergravity failed for a very simple reason: \\nWhenever we tried to calculate numbers from these theories, we would \\narrive at meaningless infinities. The theory, although it had fewer infin- \\nities than the original Kaluza-Klein theory, was still nonrenormalizable. \\n\\nThere were other problems. The highest symmetry that supergravity \\ncould include was called 0(8), which was too small to accommodate the \\nsymmetry of the Standard Model. Supergravity, it appeared, was just \\nanother step in the long journey toward a unified theory of the universe. \\nIt cured one problem (turning wood into marble), only to fall victim to \\nseveral other diseases. However, just as interest in supergravity began to \\nwane, a new theory came along that was perhaps the strangest but most \\npowerful physical theory ever proposed: the ten-dimensional superstring \\ntheory. \\n\\n\\n\\n7 \\n\\nSuperstrings \\n\\n\\nString theory is twenty-first century physics that fell acciden- \\ntally into the twentieth century. \\n\\nEdward Witten \\n\\n\\nE DWARD Witten, of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, \\nNew Jersey, dominates the world of theoretical physics. Witten is \\ncurrently the \"leader of the pack,\" the most brilliant high-energy phys- \\nicist, who sets trends in the physics community the way Picasso would set \\ntrends in the art world. Hundreds of physicists follow his work religiously \\nto get a glimmer of his path-breaking ideas. A colleague at Princeton, \\nSamuel Treiman, says, \"He\\'s head and shoulders above the rest. He\\'s \\nstarted whole groups of people on new paths. He produces elegant, \\nbreathtaking proofs which people gasp at, which leave them in awe.\" \\nTreiman then concludes, \"We shouldn\\'t toss comparisons with Einstein \\naround too freely, but when it comes to Witten . . .\\'\" \\n\\nWitten comes from a family of physicists. His father is Louis \\nWitten, professor of physics at the University of Cincinnati and a \\nleading authority on Einstein\\'s theory of general relativity. (His \\nfather, in fact, sometimes states that his greatest contribution to \\nphysics was producing his son.) His wife is Chiara Nappi, also a \\ntheoretical physicist at the institute. \\n\\nWitten is not like other physicists. Most of them begin their romance \\nwith physics at an early age (such as in junior high school or even ele- \\nmentary school). Witten has defied most conventions, starting out as a \\n\\n\\n151 \\n\\n\\n\\n152 \\n\\n\\nUNIFICATION IN TEN DIMENSIONS \\n\\n\\nhistory major at Brandeis University with an intense interest in linguis- \\ntics. After graduating in 1971. he worked on George McGovern\\'s presi- \\ndential campaign. McGovern even wrote him a letter of recommenda- \\ntion for graduate school. Witten has published articles in The Nation and \\nthe New Republic. (Scientific American, in an interview with Witten, com- \\nmented, \"yes, a man who is arguably the smartest person in the world \\nis a liberal Democrat.\\'\") \\n\\nBut once Witten decided that physics was his chosen profession, he \\nlearned physics with a vengeance. He became a graduate student at \\nPrinceton, taught at Harvard, and then rocketed a full professorship at \\nPrinceton at the age of 28. He also received the prestigious MacArthur \\nFellowship (sometimes dubbed the \"genius\" award by the press). Spi- \\nnoffs from his work have also deeply affected the world of mathematics. \\nIn 1990, he was awarded the Fields Medal, which is as prestigious as the \\nNobel Prize in the world of mathematics. \\n\\nMost of the time, however, Witten sits and stares out the window, \\nmanipulating and rearranging vast arrays of equations in his head. His \\nwife notes, \"He never does calculations except in his mind. I will fill \\npages with calculations before I understand what I\\'m doing. But Edward \\nwill sit down only to calculate a minus sign, or a factor of two.\\'\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Witten \\nsays, \"Most people who haven\\'t been trained in physics probably think \\nofwhat physicists do as a question of incredibly complicated calculations, \\nbut that\\'s not really the essence of it. The essence of it is that physics is \\nabout concepts, wanting to understand the concepts, the principles by \\nwhich the world works.\"* \\n\\nWitten\\'s next project is the most ambitious and daring of his career. \\nA new theory called superstring theory has created a sensation in the \\nworld of physics, claiming to be the theory that can unite Einstein\\'s \\ntheory of gravity with the quantum theory. Witten is not content, how- \\never, with the way superstring theory is currently formulated. He has set \\nfor himself the problem of finding the origin of superstring theory, which \\nmay prove to be a decisive development toward explaining the very \\ninstant of Creation. The key aspect of this theory, the factor that gives it \\nits power as well as uniqueness, is its unusual geometry: Strings can \\nvibrate self-consistently only in ten and 26 dimensions. \\n\\n\\nWhat Is a Particle? \\n\\n\\nThe essence of string theory is that it can explain the nature of both \\nmatter and space-time \\xe2\\x80\\x94 that is, the nature of wood and marble. String \\n\\n\\n\\nSuperstrings \\n\\n\\n153 \\n\\n\\ntheory answers a series of puzzling questions about particles, such as why \\nthere are so many of them in nature. The deeper we probe into the \\nnature of subatomic particles, the more particles we find. The current \\n\"zoo\" of subatomic particles numbers several hundred, and their prop- \\nerties fill entire volumes. Even with the Standard Model, we are left with \\na bewildering number of \"elementary particles.\" String theory answers \\nthis question because the string, about 100 billion billion times smaller \\nthan a proton, is vibrating; each mode of vibration represents a distinct \\nresonance or particle. The string is so incredibly tiny that, from a dis- \\ntance, a resonance of a string and a particle are indistinguishable. Only \\nwhen we somehow magnify the particle can we see that it is not a point \\nat all, but a mode of a vibrating string. \\n\\nIn this picture, each subatomic particle corresponds to a distinct res- \\nonance that vibrates only at a distinct frequency. The idea of a resonance \\nis a familiar one from daily life. Think of the example of singing in the \\nshower. Although our natural voice may be frail, tinny, or shaky, we know \\nthat we suddenly blossom into opera stars in the privacy of our showers. \\nThis is because our sound waves bounce rapidly back and forth between \\nthe walls of the shower. Vibrations that can fit easily within the shower \\nwalls are magnified many times, producing that resonant sound. The \\nspecific vibrations are called resonances, while other vibrations (whose \\nwaves are of an incorrect size) are canceled out. \\n\\nOr think of a violin string, which can vibrate at different frequencies, \\ncreating musical notes like A, B, and C. The only modes that can survive \\non the string are those that vanish at the endpoint of the violin string \\n(because it is bolted down at the ends) and undulate an integral number \\nof times between the endpoints. In principle, the string can vibrate at \\nany of an infinite number of different frequencies. We know that the \\nnotes themselves are not fundamental. The note A is no more funda- \\nmental than the note B. However, what is fundamental is the string itself. \\nThere is no need to study each note in isolation of the others. By under- \\nstanding how a violin string vibrates, we immediately understand the \\nproperties of an infinite number of musical notes. \\n\\nLikewise, the particles of the universe are not, by themselves, fun- \\ndamental. An electron is no more fundamental than a neutrino. They \\nappear to be fundamental only because our microscopes are not pow- \\nerful enough to reveal their structure. According to string theory, if we \\ncould somehow magnify a point particle, we would actually see a small \\nvibrating string. In fact, according to this theory, matter is nothing but \\nthe harmonies created by this vibrating string. Since there are an infinite \\nnumber of harmonies that can be composed for the violin, there are an \\n\\n\\n\\n154 \\n\\n\\nUNIFICATION IN TEN DIMENSIONS \\n\\n\\ninfinite number of forms of matter that can be constructed out of vibrat- \\ning strings. This explains the richness of the particles in nature. Likewise, \\nthe laws of physics can be compared to the laws of harmony allowed on \\nthe string. The universe itself, composed of countless vibrating strings, \\nwould then be comparable to a symphony. \\n\\nString theory can explain not only the nature of particles, but that \\nof space-time as well. As a string moves in space-time, it executes a \\ncomplicated set of motions. The string can. in turn, break into smaller \\nstrings or collide with other strings to form longer strings. The key point \\nis that all these quantum corrections or loop diagrams are finite and \\ncalculable. This is the first quantum theory of gravity in the history of \\nphysics to have finite quantum corrections. ( All known previous theories, \\nwe recall \\xe2\\x80\\x94 including Einstein\\'s original theory, Kaluza-Klein theory, \\nand supergravity \\xe2\\x80\\x94 failed this key criterion.) \\n\\nIn order to execute these complicated motions, a string must obey a \\nlarge set of self-consistency conditions. These self-consistency conditions \\nare so stringent that they place extraordinarily restrictive conditions on \\nspace-time. In other words, the string cannot self-consistently travel in \\nany arbitrary space-time, like a point particle. \\n\\nWhen the constraints that the string places on space-time were first \\ncalculated, physicists were shocked to find Einstein\\'s equations emerg- \\ning from the string. This was remarkable; without assuming any of Ein- \\nstein\\'s equations, physicists found that they emerged out of the string \\ntheory, as if by magic. Einstein\\'s equations were no longer found to be \\nfundamental; they could be derived from string theory. \\n\\nIf correct, then string theory solves the long-standing mystery about \\nthe nature of wood and marble. Einstein conjectured that marble alone \\nwould one day explain all the properties of wood. To Einstein, wood was \\njust a kink or vibration of space-time, nothing more or less. Quantum \\nphysicists, however, thought the opposite. They thought that marble \\ncould be turned into wood \\xe2\\x80\\x94 that is, that Einstein\\'s metric tensor could \\nbe turned into a graviton, the discrete packet of energy that carries the \\ngravitational force. These are two diametrically opposite points of view, \\nand it was long thought that a compromise between them was impossi- \\nble. The string, however, is precisely the \"missing link\" between wood \\nand marble. \\n\\nString theory can derive the particles of matter as resonances vibrat- \\ning on the string. And string theory can also derive Einstein\\'s equations \\nby demanding that the string move self-consistently in space-time. In \\nthis way, we have a comprehensive theory of both matter-energy and \\nspace-time. \\n\\n\\n\\nSuperstrings \\n\\n\\n155 \\n\\n\\nThese self-consistency constraints are surprisingly rigid. For example, \\nthey forbid the string to move in three or four dimensions. We will see \\nthat these self-consistency conditions force the string to move in a spe- \\ncific number of dimensions. In fact, the only \"magic numbers\" allowed \\nby string theory are ten and 26 dimensions. Fortunately, a string theory \\ndefined in these dimensions has enough \"room\" to unify all fundamen- \\ntal forces. \\n\\nString theory, therefore, is rich enough to explain all the fundamen- \\ntal laws of nature. Starting from a simple theory of a vibrating string, \\none can extract the theory of Einstein, Kaluza-Klein theory, supergrav- \\nity, the Standard Model, and even GUT theory. It seems nothing less \\nthan a miracle that, starting from some purely geometric arguments \\nfrom a string, one is able to rederive the entire progress of physics for \\nthe past 2 millennia. All the theories so far discussed in this book are \\nautomatically included in string theory. \\n\\nThe current interest in string theory stems from the work ofjohn \\nSchwarz of the California Institute of Technology and his collaborator \\nMichael Green of Queen Mary\\'s College in London. Previously, it was \\nthought that the string might possess defects that would prevent a fully \\nself-consistent theory. Then in 1984, these two physicists proved that all \\nself-consistency conditions on the string can be met. This, in turn, \\nignited the current stampede among young physicists to solve the theory \\nand win potential recognition. By the late 1980s, a veritable \"gold rush\" \\nbegan among physicists. (The competition among hundreds of the \\nworld\\'s brightest theoretical physicists to solve the theory has become \\nquite fierce. In fact, the cover of Discover recently featured string theorist \\nD. V. Nanopoulous ofTexas, who openly boasted that he was hot on the \\ntrail of winning the Nobel Prize in physics. Rarely has such an abstract \\ntheory aroused such passions.) \\n\\n\\nWhy Strings? \\n\\nI once had lunch with a Nobel Prize winner in physics at a Chinese \\nrestaurant in New York. While we were passing the sweet and sour pork, \\nthe subject of superstring theory came up. Without warning, he \\nlaunched into a long personal discussion of why superstring theory was \\nnot the correct path for young theoretical physicists. It was a wild-goose \\nchase, he claimed. There had never been anything like it in the history \\nof physics, so he found it too bizarre for his tastes. It was too alien, too \\n\\n\\n\\n156 \\n\\n\\nUNIFICATION IN TEN DIMENSIONS \\n\\n\\northogonal to all the previous trends in science. After a long discussion, \\nit boiled down to one question: Why strings? Why not vibrating solids or \\nblobs? \\n\\nThe physical world, he reminded me, uses the same concepts over \\nand over again. Nature is like a work by Bach or Beethoven, often start- \\ning with a central theme and making countless variations on it that are \\nscattered throughout the symphony. By this criterion, it appears that \\nstrings are not fundamental concepts in nature. \\n\\nThe concept of orbits, for example, occurs repeatedly in nature in \\ndifferent variations; since the work of Copernicus, orbits have provided \\nan essential theme that is constantly repeated throughout nature in dif- \\nferent variations, from the largest galaxy to the atom, to the smallest \\nsubatomic particle. Similarly, Faraday\\'s fields have proved to be one of \\nnature\\'s favorite themes. Fields can describe the galaxy\\'s magnetism and \\ngravitation, or they can describe the electromagnetic theory of Maxwell, \\nthe metric theory of Riemann and Einstein, and the Yang-Mills fields \\nfound in the Standard Model. Field theory, in fact, has emerged as the \\nuniversal language of subatomic physics, and perhaps the universe as \\nwell. It is the single most powerful weapon in the arsenal of theoretical \\nphysics. All known forms of matter and energy have been expressed in \\nterms of field theory. Patterns, then, like themes and variations in a \\nsymphony, are constantly repeated. \\n\\nBut strings? Strings do not seem to be a pattern favored by nature in \\ndesigning the heavens. We do not see strings in outer space. In fact, my \\ncolleague explained to me, we do not see strings anywhere. \\n\\nA moment\\'s thought, however, will reveal that nature has reserved \\nthe string for a special role, as a basic building block for other forms. \\nFor example, the essential feature of life on earth is the stringlike DNA \\nmolecule, which contains the complex information and coding of life \\nitself. When building the stuff of life, as well as subatomic matter, strings \\nseem to be the perfect answer. In both cases, we want to pack a large \\namount of information into a relatively simple, reproducible structure. \\nThe distinguishing feature ofa string is that it is one of the most compact \\nways of storing vast amounts of data in a way in which information can \\nbe replicated. \\n\\nFor living things, nature uses the double strands of the DNA mole- \\ncule, which unwind and form duplicate copies of each other. Also, \\nour bodies contain billions upon billions of protein strings, \\nformed of amino acid building blocks. Our bodies, in some sense, can \\nbe viewed as a vast collection of strings \\xe2\\x80\\x94 protein molecules draped \\naround our bones. \\n\\n\\n\\nSuperstrings \\n\\n\\n157 \\n\\n\\nThe String Quartet \\n\\nCurrently, the most successful version of string theory is the one created \\nby Princeton physicists David Gross, Emil Martinec, Jeffrey Harvey, and \\nRyan Rohm, who are sometimes called the Princeton string quartet. The \\nmost senior of them is David Gross. At most seminars in Princeton, Wit- \\nten may ask questions in his soft voice, but Gross\\'s voice is unmistakable: \\nloud, booming, and demanding. Anyone who gives a seminar at Prince- \\nton lives in fear of the sharp, rapid-fire questions that Gross will shoot \\nat them. What is remarkable is that his questions are usually on the mark. \\nGross and his collaborators proposed what is called the heterotic string. \\nToday, it is precisely the heterotic string, of all the various Kaluza-Klein- \\ntype theories that have been proposed in the past, that has the greatest \\npotential of unifying all the laws of nature into one theory. \\n\\nGross believes that string theory solves the problem of turning wood \\ninto marble: \"To build matter itself from geometry \\xe2\\x80\\x94 that in a sense is \\nwhat string theory does. It can be thought of that way, especially in a \\ntheory like the heterotic string which is inherently a theory of gravity in \\nwhich the particles of matter as well as the other forces of nature emerge \\nin the same way that gravity emerges from geometry.\"\\xe2\\x80\\x99 \\n\\nThe most remarkable feature of string theory, as we have empha- \\nsized, is that Einstein\\'s theory of gravity is automatically contained in it. \\nIn fact, the graviton (the quantum of gravity) emerges as the smallest \\nvibration of the closed string. While GUTs strenuously avoided any men- \\ntion of Einstein\\'s theory of gravity, the superstring theories demand that \\nEinstein\\'s theory be included. For example, if we simply drop Einstein\\'s \\ntheory of gravity as one vibration of the string, then the theory becomes \\ninconsistent and useless. This, in fact, is the reason why Witten was \\nattracted to string theory in the first place. In 1982, he read a review \\narticle by John Schwarz and was stunned to realize that gravity emerges \\nfrom superstring theory from self-consistency requirements alone. He \\nrecalls that it was \"the greatest intellectual thrill of my life.\" Witten says, \\n\"String theory is extremely attractive because gravity is forced upon us. \\nAll known consistent string theories include gravity, so while gravity is \\nimpossible in quantum field theory as we have known it, it\\'s obligatory \\nin string theory.\"\" \\n\\nGross takes satisfaction in believing that Einstein, if he were alive, \\nwould love superstring theory. He would love the fact that the beauty \\nand simplicity of superstring theory ultimately come from a geometric \\nprinciple, whose precise nature is still unknown. Gross claims, \"Einstein \\nwould have been pleased with this, at least with the goal, if not the real- \\n\\n\\n\\n158 \\n\\n\\nUNIFICATION IN TEN DIMENSIONS \\n\\n\\nization.. . . He would have liked the fact that there is an underlying \\ngeometrical principle \\xe2\\x80\\x94 which, unfortunately, we don\\'t really under- \\nstand.\"\\xe2\\x80\\x99 \\n\\nWitten even goes so far as to say that \"all the really great ideas in \\nphysics\" are \"spinoffs\" of superstring theory. By this, he means that all \\nthe great advances in theoretical physics are included within superstring \\ntheory. He even claims that Einstein\\'s general relativity theory being \\ndiscovered before superstring theory was \"a mere accident of the devel- \\nopment on planet Earth.\" He claims that, somewhere in outer space, \\n\"other civilizations in the universe\" might have discovered superstring \\ntheory first, and derived general relativity as a by-product.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 \\n\\n\\nCompactification and Beauty \\n\\nString theory is such a promising candidate for physics because it gives \\na simple origin of the symmetries found in particle physics as well as \\ngeneral relativity. \\n\\nWe saw in Chapter 6 that supergravity was both nonrenormalizable \\nand too small to accommodate the symmetry of the Standard Model. \\nHence, it was not self-consistent and did not begin to realistically \\ndescribe the known particles. However, string theory does both. As we \\nshall soon see, it banishes the infinities found in quantum gravity, yield- \\ning a finite theory of quantum gravity. That alone would guarantee that \\nstring theory should be taken as a serious candidate for a theory of the \\nuniverse. However, there is an added bonus. When we compactify some \\nof the dimensions of the string, we find that there is \"enough room\" to \\naccommodate the symmetries of the Standard Model and even the \\nGUTs. \\n\\nThe heterotic string consists of a closed string that has two types of \\nvibrations, clockwise and counterclockwise, which are treated differ- \\nently. The clockwise vibrations live in a ten-dimensional space. The coun- \\nterclockwise live in a 26-dimensional space, ofwhich 16 dimensions have \\nbeen compactified. (We recall that in Kaluza\\'s original five-dimensional \\ntheory, the fifth dimension was compactified by being wrapped up into \\na circle.) The heterotic string owes its name to the fact that the clockwise \\nand the counterclockwise vibrations live in two different dimensions but \\nare combined to produce a single superstring theory. That is why it is \\nnamed after the Greek word for heterosis, which means \"hybrid vigor.\" \\n\\nThe 16-dimensional compactified space is by far the most interesting. \\nIn Kaluza-Klein theory, we recall that the compactified N-dimensional \\n\\n\\n\\nSuperstrings \\n\\n\\n159 \\n\\n\\nspace can have a symmetry associated with it, much like a beach ball. \\nThen all the vibrations (or fields) defined on the N-dimensional space \\nautomatically inherit these symmetries. If the symmetry is SU(N), then \\nall the vibrations on the space must obey SU(N) symmetry (in the same \\nway that clay inherits the symmetries of the mold). In this way, Kaluza- \\nKlein theory could accommodate the symmetries of the Standard Model. \\nHowever, in this way it could also be determined that the supergravity \\nwas \"too small\" to contain all the particles of the symmetries found in \\nthe Standard Model. This was sufficient to kill the supergravity theory \\nas a realistic theory of matter and space-time. \\n\\nBut when the Princeton string quartet analyzed the symmetries of \\nthe 16-dimensional space, they found that it is a monstrously large sym- \\nmetry, called E(8) X E(8), which is much larger than any GUT symmetry \\nthat has ever been tried. This was an unexpected bonus. It meant that \\nthat all the vibrations of the string would inherit the symmetry of the \\n16-dimensional space, which was more than enough to accommodate \\nthe symmetry of the Standard Model. \\n\\nThis, then, is the mathematical expression of the central theme of \\nthe book, that the laws of physics simplify in higher dimensions. In this \\ncase, the 26-dimensional space of the counterclockwise vibrations of the \\nheterotic string has room enough to explain all the symmetries found \\nin both Einstein\\'s theory and quantum theory. So, for the first time,, \\npure geometry has given a simple explanation of why the subatomic \\nworld must necessarily exhibit certain symmetries that emerge from the \\ncurling up of higher-dimensional space: The symmetries of the subatomic \\nrealm are but remnants of the symmetry of higher-dimensional space. \\n\\nThis means that the beauty and symmetry found in nature can ulti- \\nmately be traced back to higher-dimensional space. For example, snow- \\nflakes create beautiful, hexagonal patterns, none of which are precisely \\nthe same. These snowflakes and crystals, in turn, have inherited their \\nstructure from the way in which their molecules have been geometrically \\narranged. This arrangement is mainly determined by the electron shells \\nof the molecule, which in turn take us back to the rotational symmetries \\nof the quantum theory, given by 0(3). All the symmetries of the low- \\nenergy universe that we observe in chemical elements are due to the \\nsymmetries cataloged by the Standard Model, which in turn can be \\nderived by compactifying the heterotic string. \\n\\nIn conclusion, the symmetries that we see around us, from rainbows \\nto blossoming flowers to crystals, may ultimately be viewed as manifes- \\ntations of fragments of the original ten-dimensional theory. 1 Riemann \\nand Einstein had hoped to find a geometric understanding ofwhy forces \\n\\n\\n\\n160 \\n\\n\\nUNIFICATION IN TEN DIMENSIONS \\n\\n\\ncan determine the motion and the nature of matter. But they were miss- \\ning a key ingredient in showing the relationship between wood and mar- \\nble. This missing link is most likely superstring theory. With the ten- \\ndimensional string theory, we see that the geometry of the string may \\nultimately be responsible for both the forces and the structure of matter. \\n\\n\\nA Piece of Twenty-First-Century Physics \\n\\nGiven the enormous power of its symmetries, it is not surprising that \\nsuperstring theory is radically different from any other kind of physics. \\nIt was, in fact, discovered quite by accident. Many physicists have com- \\nmented that if this fortuitous accident had never occurred, then the \\ntheory would not have been discovered until the twenty-first century. \\nThis is because it is such a sharp departure from all the ideas tried in \\nthis century. It is not a continuous extension of trends and theories \\npopular in this century; it stands apart. \\n\\nBy contrast, the theory of general relativity had a \"normal\" and log- \\nical evolution. First, Einstein postulated the equivalence principle. Then \\nhe reformulated this physical principle in the mathematics of a field \\ntheory of gravitation based on Faraday\\'s fields and Riemann\\'s metric \\ntensor. Later came the \"classical solutions,\" such as the black hole and \\nthe Big Bang. Finally, the last stage is the current attempt to formulate \\na quantum theory of gravity. Thus general relativity went through a log- \\nical progression, from a physical principle to a quantum theory: \\n\\nGeometry \\xe2\\x80\\x94 \\xc2\\xbb field theory \\xe2\\x80\\x94 \\xc2\\xbb classical theory \\xe2\\x80\\x94 \\xc2\\xbb quantum theory \\n\\nBy contrast, superstring theory has been evolving backward since its \\naccidental discovery in 1968. That\\'s why superstring theory looks so \\nstrange and unfamiliar to most physicists. We are still searching for its \\nunderlying physical principle, the counterpart to Einstein\\'s equivalence \\nprinciple. \\n\\nThe theory was bom quite by accident in 1968 when two young the- \\noretical physicists, Gabriel Veneziano and Mahiko Suzuki, were inde- \\npendently leafing through math books, looking for mathematical func- \\ntions that would describe the interactions of strongly interacting \\nparticles. While studying at CERN, the European center for theoretical \\nphysics in Geneva, Switzerland, they independently stumbled on the \\nEuler beta function, a mathematical function written down in the nine- \\nteenth century by the mathematician Leonhard Euler. They were aston- \\n\\n\\n\\nSuperstrings \\n\\n\\n161 \\n\\n\\nished to find that the Euler beta function fit almost all the properties \\nrequired to describe the strong interactions of elementary particles. \\n\\nOver lunch at the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory in California, with \\na spectacular view of the sun blazing down over San Francisco harbor, \\nSuzuki once explained to me the thrill of discovering, quite by accident, \\na potentially important result. Physics was not supposed to happen that \\nway. \\n\\nAfter finding the Euler beta function in a math book, he excitedly \\nshowed his result to a senior physicist at CERN. The senior physicist, \\nafter listening to Suzuki, was not impressed. In fact, he told Suzuki that \\nanother young physicist (Veneziano) had discovered the identical func- \\ntion a few weeks earlier. He discouraged Suzuki from publishing his \\nresult. Today, this beta function goes by the name of the Veneziano \\nmodel, which has inspired several thousand research papers, spawned a \\nmajor school of physics, and now makes the claim of unifying all physical \\nlaws. (In retrospect, Suzuki, of course, should have published his result. \\nThere is a lesson to all this, I suspect: Never take too seriously the advice \\nof your superiors.) \\n\\nIn 1970, the mystery surrounding the Veneziano-Suzuki model was \\npartly explained when Yoichiro Nambu at the University of Chicago and \\nTetsuo Goto at Nihon University discovered that a vibrating string lies \\nbehind its wondrous properties. \\n\\nBecause string theory was discovered backward and by accident, phys- \\nicists still do not know the physical principle that underlies string theory. \\nThe last step in the evolution of the theory (and the first step in the \\nevolution of general relativity) is still missing. \\n\\nWitten adds that \\n\\nhuman beings on planet Earth never had the conceptual framework that \\nwould lead them to invent string theory on purpose. . . . No one invented \\nit on purpose, it was invented in a lucky accident. By rights, twentieth- \\ncentury physicists shouldn\\'t have had the privilege of studying this theory. \\n\\nBy rights, string theory shouldn\\'t have been invented until our knowledge \\nof some of the ideas that are prerequisite for string theory had developed \\nto the point that it was possible for us to have the right concept ofwhat it \\nwas all about . 11 \\n\\n\\nLoops \\n\\n\\nThe formula discovered by Veneziano and Suzuki, which they hoped \\nwould describe the properties of interacting subatomic particles, was still \\n\\n\\n\\n162 \\n\\n\\nUNIFICATION IN TEN DIMENSIONS \\n\\n\\nincomplete. It violated one of the properties of physics: unitarity, or the \\nconservation of probability. By itself, the Veneziano-Suzuki formula \\nwould give incorrect answers for particle interactions. So the next step \\nin the theory\\'s evolution was to add small quantum correction terms \\nthat would restore this property. In 1969, even before the string inter- \\npretation of Nambu and Goto, three physicists (Keiji Kikkawa, Bunji \\nSakita, and Miguel A. Virasoro, then all at the University of Wisconsin) \\nproposed the correct solution: adding increasingly smaller terms to the \\nVeneziano-Suzuki formula in order to restore unitarity. \\n\\nAlthough these physicists had to guess at how to construct the series \\nfrom scratch, today it is most easily understood in the framework of the \\nstring picture of Nambu. For example, when a bumblebee flies in space, \\nits path can be described as a wiggly line. When a piece of string drifting \\nin the air moves in space, its path can be likened to an imaginary two- \\ndimensional sheet. When a closed string floats in space, its path resem- \\nbles a tube. \\n\\nStrings interact by breaking into smaller strings and byjoining with \\nother strings. When these interacting strings move, they trace out the \\nconfigurations shown in Figure 7.1. Notice that two tubes come in from \\nthe left, with one tube fissioning in half, exchange the middle tube, and \\nthen veer off to the right. This is how tubes interact with each other. \\nThis diagram, of course, is shorthand for a very complicated mathemat- \\nical expression. When we calculate the numerical expression corre- \\nsponding to these diagrams, we get back the Euler beta function. \\n\\nIn the string picture, the essential trick proposed by Kikkawa-Sakita- \\nVirasoro (KSV) amounted to adding all possible diagrams where strings \\ncan collide and break apart. There are, of course, an infinite number of \\nthese diagrams. The process of adding an infinite number of \"loop\" \\ndiagrams, with each diagram coming closer to the final answer, is per- \\nturbation theory and is one of most important weapons in the arsenal \\nof any quantum physicist. (These string diagrams possess a beautiful \\nsymmetry that has never been seen in physics before, which is known as \\nconformal symmetry in two dimensions. This conformal symmetry allows \\nus to treat these tubes and sheets as though they were made of rubber: \\nWe can pull, stretch, bend, and shrink these diagrams. Then, because \\nof conformal symmetry, we can prove that all these mathematical expres- \\nsions remain the same.) \\n\\nKSV claimed that the sum total of all these loop diagrams would yield \\nthe precise mathematical formula explaining how subatomic particles \\ninteract. However, the KSV program consisted of a series of unproven \\nconjectures. Someone had to construct these loops explicitly, or else \\nthese conjectures were useless. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n+ \\n\\n\\nFigure 7.1. In string theory, the gravitational force is represented by the exchange \\nof closed strings, which sweep out tubes in space-time. Even if we add up an \\ninfinite series of diagrams with a large number of holes, infinities never appear \\nin the theory, giving us a finite theory of quantum gravity. \\n\\n\\n163 \\n\\n\\n\\n164 \\n\\n\\nUNIFICATION IN TEN DIMENSIONS \\n\\n\\nIntrigued by the program being initiated by KSV, I decided to try my \\nluck at solving the problem. This was a bit difficult, because I was dodg- \\ning machine-gun bullets at the time. \\n\\n\\nBoot Camp \\n\\nI remember clearly when the KSV paper came out in 1969. KSV was \\nproposing a program for future work, rather than giving precise details. \\nI decided then to calculate all possible loops explicitly and complete the \\nKSV program. \\n\\nIt\\'s hard to forget those times. There was a war raging overseas, and \\nthe university campuses from Kent State to the University of Paris, were \\nin a state of turmoil. I had graduated from Harvard the year before, \\nwhen President Lyndon Johnson revoked deferments for graduate stu- \\ndents, sending panic throughout graduate schools in the country. Chaos \\ngripped the campuses. Suddenly, my friends were dropping out of col- \\nlege, teaching high school, packing their bags and heading to Canada, \\nor trying to ruin their health in order to flunk the army physical. \\n\\nPromising careers were being shattered. One of my good friends in \\nphysics from MIT vowed that he would go to jail rather than fight in \\nVietnam. He told us to send copies of the Physical Review to hisjail cell \\nso he could keep up with developments in the Veneziano model. Other \\nfriends, who quit college to teach in high schools rather than fight in \\nthe war, terminated promising scientific careers. (Many of them still \\nteach in these high schools.) \\n\\nThree days after graduation, I left Cambridge and found myself in \\nthe United States Army stationed at Fort Benning, Georgia (the largest \\ninfantry training center in the world), and later at Fort Lewis, Washing- \\nton. Tens of thousands of raw recruits with no previous military training \\nwere being hammered into a fighting force and then shipped to Viet- \\nnam, replacing the 500 GIs who were dying every week. \\n\\nOne day, while throwing live grenades under the grueling Georgia \\nsun and seeing the deadly shrapnel scatter in all directions, my thoughts \\nbegan to wander. How many scientists throughout history had to face \\nthe punishing ravages of war? How many promising scientists were \\nsnuffed out by a bullet in the prime of their youth? \\n\\nI remembered that Karl Schwarzschild had died in the kaiser\\'s army \\non the Russian front during World War I just a few months after he \\nfound the basic solution to Einstein\\'s equations used in every black hole \\ncalculation. (The Schwarzschild radius of a black hole is named in his \\n\\n\\n\\nSuperstrings \\n\\n\\n166 \\n\\n\\nhonor. Einstein addressed the Prussian Academy in 1916 to commem- \\norate Schwarzschild\\'s work after his untimely death at the front lines.) \\nAnd how many promising people were cut down even before they could \\nbegin their careers? \\n\\nInfantry training, I discovered, is rigorous; it is designed to toughen \\nthe spirit and dull the intellect. Independence of thought is ground out \\nof you. After all, the military does not necessarily want some wit who will \\nquestion the sergeant\\'s orders in the middle of a firefight. Understand- \\ning this, I decided to bring along some physics papers. I needed some- \\nthing to keep my mind active while peeling potatoes in KP or firing \\nmachine guns, so I brought along a copy of the KSV paper. \\n\\nDuring night infantry training, I had to go past an obstacle course, \\nwhich meant dodging live machine-gun bullets, froglegging under \\nbarbed wire, and crawling through thick brown mud. Because the auto- \\nmatic fire had tracers on them, I could see the beautiful crimson streaks \\nmade by thousands of machine-gun bullets sailing a few feet over my \\nhead. However, my thoughts kept drifting back to the KSV paper and \\nhow their program could be carried out. \\n\\nFortunately, the essential feature of the calculation was strictly topo- \\nlogical. It was clear to me that these loops were introducing an entirely \\nnew language to physics, the language of topology. Never before in the \\nhistory of physics had Mobius strips or Klein bottles been used in a fun- \\ndamental way. \\n\\nBecause I rarely had any paper or pencils while practicing with \\nmachine guns, I forced myself to visualize in my head how strings could \\nbe twisted into loops and turned inside out. Machine-gun training was \\nactually a blessing in disguise because it forced me to manipulate large \\nblocks of equations in my head. By the time I finished the advanced \\nmachine-gun-training program, I was convinced that I could complete \\nthe program of calculating all loops. \\n\\nFinally, I managed to squeeze time from the army to go to the Uni- \\nversity of California at Berkeley, where I furiously worked out the details \\nthat were racing in my head. I sank several hundred hours of intense \\nthought into the question. This, in fact, became my Ph.D. dissertation. \\n\\nBy 1970, the final calculation took up several hundred densely filled \\nnotebook pages. Under the careful supervision of my adviser, Stanley \\nMandelstam, my colleague Loh-ping Yu and I successfully calculated an \\nexplicit expression for all possible loop diagrams known at that time. \\nHowever, I wasn\\'t satisfied with this work. The KSV program consisted \\nof a hodge-podge of rules of thumb and intuition, not a rigorous set of \\nbasic principles from which these loops could be derived. String theory. \\n\\n\\n\\n166 \\n\\n\\nUNIFICATION IN TEN DIMENSIONS \\n\\n\\nwe saw, was evolving backward, since its accidental discovery by Vene- \\nziano and Suzuki. The next step in the backward evolution of the string \\nwas to follow in the footsteps ofFaraday, Riemann, Maxwell, and Einstein \\nand construct a field theory of strings. \\n\\n\\nField Theory of Strings \\n\\nEver since the pioneering work of Faraday, every physical theory had \\nbeen written in terms of fields. Maxwell\\'s theory of light was based on \\nfield theory. So was Einstein\\'s. In fact, all of particle physics was based \\non field theory. The only theory not based on field theory was string \\ntheory. The KSV program was more a set of convenient rules than a field \\ntheory. \\n\\nMy next goal was to rectify that situation. The problem with a field \\ntheory of strings, however, was that many of the pioneering figures in \\nphysics argued against it. Their arguments were simple. These giants of \\nphysics, such as Hideki Yukawa and Werner Heisenberg, had labored \\nfor years to create a field theory that was not based on point particles. \\nElementary particles, they thought, might be pulsating blobs of matter, \\nrather than points. However, no matter how hard they tried, field the- \\nories based on blobs always violated causality. \\n\\nIf we were to shake the blob at one point, the interactions would \\nspread faster than the speed of light throughout the blob, violating spe- \\ncial relativity and creating all sorts of time paradoxes. Thus \"nonlocal \\nfield theories\" based on blobs were known to be a monstrously difficult \\nproblem. Many physicists, in fact, insisted that only local field theories \\nbased on point particles could be consistent. Nonlocal field theories \\nmust violate relativity. \\n\\nThe second argument was even more convincing. The Veneziano \\nmodel had many magical properties (including something called dual- \\nity) that had never been seen before in field theory. Years earlier, Rich- \\nard Feynman had given \"rules\" that any field theory should obey. How- \\never, these Feynman rules were in direct violation of duality. Thus many \\nstring theorists were convinced that a field theory of strings was impos- \\nsible because string theory necessarily violated the properties of the \\nVeneziano model. String theory, they said, was unique in all of physics \\nbecause it could not be recast as a field theory. \\n\\nI collaborated with Keiji Kikkawa on this difficult but important prob- \\nlem. Step by step we built our field theory, in much the same way that \\nour predecessors had constructed field theories for other forces. Follow- \\n\\n\\n\\nSuperstrings \\n\\n\\n167 \\n\\n\\ning Faraday, we introduced a field at every point in space-time. Flowever, \\nfor a field theory of strings, we had to generalize the concept of Faraday \\nand postulate a field that was defined for all possible configurations of \\na string vibrating in space-time. \\n\\nThe second step was to postulate the field equations that the string \\nobeyed. The field equation for a single string moving alone in space- \\ntime was easy. As expected, our field equations reproduced an infinite \\nseries of string resonances, each corresponding to a subatomic particle. \\nNext, we found that the objections of Yukawa and Heisenberg were \\nsolved by string field theory. If we jiggled the string, the vibrations trav- \\neled down the string at less than the speed of light. \\n\\nSoon, however, we hit a brick wall. When we tried to introduce inter- \\nacting strings, we could not reproduce the Veneziano amplitude cor- \\nrectly. Duality and the counting of graphs given by Feynman for any \\nfield theory were in direct conflict. Just as the critics expected, the Feyn- \\nman graphs were incorrect. This was disheartening. It appeared that \\nfield theory, which had formed the foundation of physics for the past \\ncentury, was fundamentally incompatible with string theory. \\n\\nDiscouraged, I remember mulling over the problem late into the \\nnight. For hours, I began systematically to check all the possible alter- \\nnatives to this problem. But the conclusion that duality had to be broken \\nseemed inescapable. Then I remembered what Sherlock Holmes, in \\nArthur Conan Doyle\\'s \"The Sign of Four,\" said to Watson: \"How often \\nhave I said to you that when you have eliminated the impossible, what- \\never remains, however improbable, must be the truth.\" Encouraged by this \\nidea, I eliminated all the impossible alternatives. The only improbable \\nalternative remaining was to violate the properties of the Veneziano- \\nSuzuki formula. At about 3:00 A.M., the resolution finally hit me. I real- \\nized that physicists had overlooked the obvious fact that one can split \\nthe Veneziano-Suzuki formula into two pieces. Each part then corre- \\nsponds to one of Feynman\\'s diagrams, and each part violates duality, \\nbut the sum obeys all the correct properties of a field theory. \\n\\nI quickly took out some paper and went over the calculation. I spent \\nthe next 5 hours checking and rechecking the calculation from all pos- \\nsible directions. The conclusion was inescapable: Field theory does vio- \\nlate duality, as everyone expected, but this is acceptable because the final \\nsum reproduces the Veneziano-Suzuki formula. \\n\\nI had now solved most of the problem. However, one more Feynman \\ndiagram, representing the collision of four strings, was still lacking. That \\nyear, I was teaching introductory electricity and magnetism to under- \\ngraduates at the City University of New York, and we were studying Far- \\n\\n\\n\\n168 \\n\\n\\nUNIFICATION IN TEN DIMENSIONS \\n\\n\\naday\\'s lines of force. I would ask the students to draw the lines of force \\nemanating from different configurations of charges, repeating the same \\nsteps pioneered by Faraday in the nineteenth century. Suddenly, it \\ndawned on me that the squiggly lines that I was asking my students to \\ndraw had exactly the same topological structure as the collision of \\nstrings. Thus by rearranging charges in a freshman laboratory, I had \\nfound the correct configuration describing the collision of four strings. \\n\\nWas it that simple? \\n\\nI rushed home to check my hunch, and I was right. By employing \\npictorial techniques that even a freshman can use, I could show that the \\nfour-string interaction must be hidden within the Veneziano formula. \\nBy the winter of 1974, using methods dating back to Faraday, Kikkawa \\nand I completed the field theory of strings, the first successful attempt \\nto combine string theory with the formalism of field theory. \\n\\nOur field theory, although it correctly embodied the entire infor- \\nmation contained within string theory, still needed improvement. \\nBecause we were constructing the field theory backward, many of the \\nsymmetries were still obscure. For example, the symmetries of special \\nrelativity were present but not in an obvious way. Much more work was \\nneeded to streamline the field equations we had found. Butjust as we \\nwere beginning to explore the properties of our field theory, the model \\nunexpectedly suffered a severe setback. \\n\\nThat year, physicist Claude Lovelace of Rutgers University discovered \\nthat the bosonic string (describing integral spins) is self-consistent only \\nin 26 dimensions. Other physicists verified this result and showed that \\nthe superstring (describing both integral and half-integral spin) is self- \\nconsistent only in ten dimensions. It was soon realized that, in dimen- \\nsions other than ten or 26 dimensions, the theory completely loses all \\nits beautiful mathematical properties. But no one believed that a theory \\ndefined in ten or 26 dimensions had anything to do with reality. \\nResearch in string theory abruptly ground to a halt. Like Kaluza-Klein \\ntheory before it, string theory lapsed into a deep hibernation. For 10 \\nlong years, the model was banished to obscurity. (Although most string \\nphysicists, myself included, abandoned the model like a sinking ship, a \\nfew die-hards, like physicists John Schwarz and the latejoel Scherk, tried \\nto keep the model alive by steadily making improvements. For example, \\nstring theory was originally thought to be just a theory of the strong \\ninteractions, with each mode of vibration corresponding to a resonance \\nof the quark model. Schwarz and Scherk correctly showed that the string \\nmodel was really a unified theory of all forces, notjust the strong inter- \\nactions.) \\n\\n\\n\\nSuperstrings \\n\\n\\n109 \\n\\n\\nResearch in quantum gravity went into other direction. From 1974 \\nto 1984, when string theory was in eclipse, a large number of alternative \\ntheories of quantum gravity were successively studied. During this \\nperiod, the original Kaluza-Klein theory and then the supergravity the- \\nory enjoyed great popularity, but each time the failures of these models \\nalso became apparent. For example, both Kaluza-Klein and supergravity \\ntheories were shown to be nonrenormalizable. \\n\\nThen something strange happened during that decade. On the one \\nhand, physicists became frustrated by the growing list of models that \\nwere tried and then discarded during this period. Everything failed. The \\nrealization came slowly that Kaluza-Klein theory and supergravity theory \\nwere probably on the right track, but they weren\\'t sophisticated enough \\nto solve the problem of nonrenormalizability . But the only theory com- \\nplex enough to contain both Kaluza-Klein theory and the supergravity \\ntheory was superstring theory. On the other hand, physicists slowly \\nbecame accustomed to working in hyperspace. Because of the Kaluza- \\nKlein renaissance, the idea ofhyperspace didn\\'t seem that farfetched or \\nforbidding anymore. Over time, even a theory defined in 26 dimensions \\ndidn\\'t seem that outlandish. The original resistance to 26 dimensions \\nbegan to slowly melt away with time. \\n\\nFinally, in 1984, Green and Schwarz proved that superstring theory \\nwas the only self-consistent theory of quantum gravity, and the stampede \\nbegan. In 1985, Edward Witten made a significant advance in the field \\ntheory of strings, which many people think is one of the most beautiful \\nachievements of the theory. He showed that our old field theory could \\nbe derived using powerful mathematical and geometric theorems (com- \\ning from something called cohomology theory ) with a fully relativistic form. \\n\\nWith Witten\\'s new field theory, the true mathematical elegance of \\nstring field theory, which was concealed in our formalism, was revealed. \\nSoon, almost a hundred scientific papers were written to explore the \\nfascinating mathematical properties of Witten\\'s field theory. \" \\n\\n\\nNo One Is Smart Enough \\n\\nAssuming that string field theory is correct, in principle we should be \\nable to calculate the mass of the proton from first principles and make \\ncontact with known data, such as the masses of the various particles. If \\nthe numerical answers are wrong, then we will have to throw the theory \\nout the window. However, if the theory is correct, it will rank among the \\nmost significant advances in physics in 2,000 years. \\n\\n\\n\\n170 \\n\\n\\nUNIFICATION IN TEN DIMENSIONS \\n\\n\\nAfter the intense, euphoric fanfare of the late 1980s (when it \\nappeared that the theory would be completely solved within a few years \\nand the Nobel Prizes handed out by the dozen), a certain degree of cold \\nrealism has set in. Although the theory is well defined mathematically, \\nno one has been able to solve the theory. No one. \\n\\nThe problem is that no one is smart enough to solve the field theory of \\nstrings or any other nonperturbative approach to string theory. This is a \\nwell-defined problem, but the irony is that solving field theory requires \\ntechniques that are currently beyond the skill of any physicist. This is \\nfrustrating. Sitting before us is a perfectly well-defined theory of strings. \\nWithin it is the possibility of settling all the controversy surrounding \\nhigher-dimensional space. The dream of calculating everything from \\nfirst principles is staring us in the face. The problem is how to solve it. \\nOne is reminded of Julius Caesar\\'s famous remark in Shakespeare\\'s play: \\n\"The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars, but in ourselves.\" For a string \\ntheorist, the fault is not in the theory, but in our primitive mathematics. \\n\\nThe reason for this pessimism is that our main calculational tool, \\nperturbation theory, fails. Perturbation theory begins with a Veneziano- \\nlike formula and then calculates quantum corrections to it (which have \\nthe shape of loops). It was the hope of string theorists that they could \\nwrite down a more advanced Veneziano-like formula defined in four \\ndimensions that would uniquely describe the known spectrum of parti- \\ncles. In retrospect, they were too successful. The problem is that millions \\nupon millions of Veneziano-like formulas have now been discovered. \\nEmbarrassingly, string theorists are literally drowning in these pertur- \\nbative solutions. \\n\\nThe fundamental problem that has stalled progress in superstring \\ntheory in the past few years is that no one knows how to select the correct \\nsolution out of the millions that have been discovered. Some of these \\nsolutions come remarkably close to describing the real world. With a few \\nmodest assumptions, it is easy to extract the Standard Model as one \\nvibration of the string. Several groups have announced, in fact, that they \\ncan find solutions that agree with the known data about subatomic par- \\nticles. \\n\\nThe problem, we see, is that there are also millions upon millions of \\nother solutions describing universes that do not appear anything like \\nour universe. In some of these solutions, the universe has no quarks or \\ntoo many quarks. In most of them, life as we know it cannot exist. Our \\nuniverse may be lost somewhere among the millions of possible universes \\nthat have been found in string theory. To find the correct solution, we \\n\\n\\n\\nSuperstrings \\n\\n\\n171 \\n\\n\\nmust use nonperturbative techniques, which are notoriously difficult. \\nSince 99% of what we know about high-energy physics is based on per- \\nturbation theory, this means that we are at a total loss to find the one \\ntrue solution to the theory. \\n\\nThere is some room for optimism, however. Nonperturbative solu- \\ntions that have been found for much simpler theories show that many \\nof the solutions are actually unstable. After a time, these incorrect, unsta- \\nble solutions will make a quantum leap to the correct, stable solution. If \\nthis is true for string theory, then perhaps the millions of solutions that \\nhave been found are actually unstable and will decay over time to the \\ncorrect solution. \\n\\nTo understand the frustration that we physicists feel, think, for a \\nmoment, of how nineteenth-century physicists might react if a portable \\ncomputer were given to them. They could easily learn to turn the dials \\nand press the buttons. They could learn to master video games or watch \\neducational programs on the monitor. Being a century behind in tech- \\nnology, they would marvel at the fantastic calculational ability of the \\ncomputer. Within its memory could easily be stored all known scientific \\nknowledge of that century. In a short period of time, they could learn \\nto perform mathematical feats that would amaze any of their colleagues. \\nHowever, once they decide to open up the monitor to see what is inside, \\nthey would be horrified. The transistors and microprocessors would be \\ntotally alien to anything they could understand. There would be really \\nnothing in their experience to compare with the electronic computer. \\nIt would be beyond their ken. They could only stare blankly at the com- \\nplicated circuitry, not knowing in the slightest how it works or what it \\nall means. \\n\\nThe source of their frustration would be that the computer exists \\nand is sitting there in front of their noses, but they would have no ref- \\nerence frame from which to explain it. Analogously, string theory \\nappears to be twenty-first-century physics that was discovered accidentally \\nin our century. String field theory, too, seems to include all physical \\nknowledge. With little effort, we are able to turn a few dials and press a \\nfew buttons with the theory, and out pops the supergravity theory, \\nKaluza-Klein theory, and the Standard Model. But we are at a total loss \\nto explain why it works. String field theory exists, but it taunts us because \\nwe are not smart enough to solve it. \\n\\nThe problem is that while twenty-first-century physics fell accidentally \\ninto the twentieth century, twenty-first-century mathematics hasn\\'t been \\ninvented yet. It seems that we may have to wait for twenty-first-century \\n\\n\\n\\n172 \\n\\n\\nUNIFICATION IN TEN DIMENSIONS \\n\\n\\nmathematics before we can make any progress, or the current genera- \\ntion of physicists must invent twenty-first-century mathematics on their \\nown. \\n\\n\\nWhy Ten Dimensions? \\n\\nOne of the deepest secrets of string theory, which is still not well under- \\nstood, is why it is defined in only ten and 26 dimensions. If the theory \\nwere three dimensional, it would not be able to unify the known laws of \\nphysics in any sensible manner. Thus it is the geometry of higher dimen- \\nsions that is the central feature of the theory. \\n\\nIf we calculate how strings break and re-form in N-dimensional space, \\nwe constantly find meaningless terms cropping up that destroy the mar- \\nvelous properties of the theory. Fortunately, these unwanted terms \\nappear multiplied by (N \\xe2\\x80\\x94 10). Therefore, to make these anomalies \\nvanish, we have no choice but to fix N to be ten. String theory, in fact, \\nis the only known quantum theory that specifically demands that the \\ndimension of space-time be fixed at a unique number. \\n\\nUnfortunately, string theorists are, at present, at a loss to explain why \\nten dimensions are singled out. The answer lies deep within mathemat- \\nics, in an area called modular functions. Whenever we manipulate the KSV \\nloop diagrams created by interacting strings, we encounter these strange \\nmodular functions, where the number ten appears in the strangest \\nplaces. These modular functions are as mysterious as the man who inves- \\ntigated them, the mystic from the East. Perhaps if we better understood \\nthe work of this Indian genius, we would understand why we live in our \\npresent universe. \\n\\n\\nThe Mystery of Modular Functions \\n\\nSrinivasa Ramanujan was the strangest man in all of mathematics, prob- \\nably in the entire history of science. He has been compared to a bursting \\nsupernova, illuminating the darkest, most profound corners of mathe- \\nmatics, before being tragically struck down by tuberculosis at the age of \\n33, like Riemann before him. Working in total isolation from the main \\ncurrents of his field, he was able to rederive 100 years\\' worth of Western \\nmathematics on his own. The tragedy of his life is that much of his work \\nwas wasted rediscovering known mathematics. Scattered throughout the \\n\\n\\n\\nSuperstrings \\n\\n\\n173 \\n\\n\\nobscure equations in his notebooks are these modular functions, which \\nare among the strangest ever found in mathematics. They reappear in \\nthe most distant and unrelated branches of mathematics. One function, \\nwhich appears again and again in the theory of modular functions, is \\ntoday called the Ramanujan function in his honor. This bizarre function \\ncontains a term raised to the twenty-fourth power. \\n\\nIn the work of Ramanujan, the number 24 appears repeatedly. This \\nis an example of what mathematicians call magic numbers, which con- \\ntinually appear, where we least expect them, for reasons that no one \\nunderstands. Miraculously, Ramanujan\\'s function also appears in string \\ntheory. The number 24 appearing in Ramanujan\\'s function is also the \\norigin of the miraculous cancellations occurring in string theory. In \\nstring theory, each of the 24 modes in the Ramanujan function corre- \\nsponds to a physical vibration of the string. Whenever the string executes \\nits complex motions in space-time by splitting and recombining, a large \\nnumber of highly sophisticated mathematical identities must be satis- \\nfied. These are precisely the mathematical identities discovered by \\nRamanujan. (Since physicists add two more dimensions when they count \\nthe total number of vibrations appearing in a relativistic theory, \\nthis means that space-time must have 24 + 2 = 26 space-time dimen- \\nsions. 11 ) \\n\\nWhen the Ramanujan function is generalized, the number 24 is \\nreplaced by the number 8. Thus the critical number for the superstring \\nis 8 + 2, or 10. This is the origin of the tenth dimension. The string \\nvibrates in ten dimensions because it requires these generalized Rama- \\nnujan functions in order to remain self-consistent. In other words, physicists \\nhave not the slightest understanding of why ten and 26 dimensions are singled \\nout as the dimension of the string. It\\'s as though there is some kind of deep \\nnumerology being manifested in these functions that no one under- \\nstands. It is precisely these magic numbers appearing in the elliptic mod- \\nular function that determines the dimension of space-time to be \\nten. \\n\\nIn the final analysis, the origin of the ten-dimensional theory is as \\nmysterious as Ramanujan himself. When asked by audiences why nature \\nmight exist in ten dimensions, physicists are forced to answer, \"We don\\'t \\nknow.\" We know, in vague terms, why some dimension of space-time \\nmust be selected (or else the string cannot vibrate in a self-consistent \\nquantum fashion), but we don\\'t know why these particular numbers are \\nselected. Perhaps the answer lies waiting to be discovered in Ramanu- \\njan\\'s lost notebooks. \\n\\n\\n\\n174 \\n\\n\\nUNIFICATION IN TEN DIMENSIONS \\n\\n\\nReinventing 100 Years of Mathematics \\n\\nRamanujan was born in 1887 in Erode, India, near Madras. Although \\nhis family was Brahmin, the highest of the Hindu castes, they were des- \\ntitute, living off the meager wages of Ramanujan\\'s father\\'sjob as a clerk \\nin a clothing merchant\\'s office. \\n\\nBy the age of 10, it was clear that Ramanujan was not like the other \\nchildren. Like Riemann before him, he became well known in his village \\nfor his awesome calculational powers. As a child, he had already rede- \\nrived Euler\\'s identity between trigonometric functions and exponentials. \\n\\nIn every young scientist\\'s life, there is a turning point, a singular \\nevent that helps to change the course of his or her life. For Einstein, it \\nwas the fascination of observing a compass needle. For Riemann, it was \\nreading Legendre\\'s book on number theory. For Ramanujan, it was \\nwhen he stumbled on an obscure, forgotten book on mathematics by \\nGeorge Carr. This book has since been immortalized by the fact that it \\nmarked Ramanujan\\'s only known exposure to modern Western mathe- \\nmatics. According to his sister, \"It was this book which awakened his \\ngenius. He set himself to establish the formulae given therein. As he was \\nwithout the aid of other books, each solution was a piece of research so \\nfar as he was concerned. . . . Ramanujan used to say that the goddess of \\nNamakkal inspired him with the formulae in dreams.\" 14 \\n\\nBecause of his brilliance, he was able to win a scholarship to high \\nschool. But because he was bored with the tedium of classwork and \\nintensely preoccupied with the equations that were constantly dancing \\nin his head, he failed to enter his senior class, and his scholarship was \\ncanceled. Frustrated, he ran away from home. He did finally return, but \\nonly to fall ill and fail his examinations again. \\n\\nWith the help of friends, Ramanujan managed to become a low-level \\nclerk in the Port Trust of Madras. It was a menial job, paying a paltry \\n\\xc2\\xa320 a year, but it freed Ramanujan, like Einstein before him at the Swiss \\npatent office, to follow his dreams in his spare time. Ramanujan then \\nmailed some of the results of his \"dreams\" to three well-known British \\nmathematicians, hoping for contact with other mathematical minds. \\nTwo of the mathematicians, receiving this letter written by an unknown \\nIndian clerk with no formal education, promptly threw it away. The third \\none was the brilliant Cambridge mathematician Godfrey H. Hardy. \\nBecause of his stature in England, Hardy was accustomed to receiving \\ncrank mail and thought dimly of the letter. Amid the dense scribbling \\nhe noticed many theorems of mathematics that were already well known. \\n\\n\\n\\nSuperstrings \\n\\n\\n175 \\n\\n\\nThinking it the obvious work of a plagiarist, he also threw it away. But \\nsomething wasn\\'t quite right. Something nagged at Hardy; he couldn\\'t \\nhelp wondering about this strange letter. \\n\\nAt dinner that night, January 16,1913, Hardy and his colleague John \\nLittlewood discussed this odd letter and decided to take a second look \\nat its contents. It began, innocently enough, with \"I beg to introduce \\nmyself to you as a clerk in the Accounts Department of the Port Trust \\nOffice of Madras on a salary of only 20 pounds per annum.\"\\xe2\\x80\\x99 But the \\nletter from the poor Madras clerk contained theorems that were totally \\nunknown to Western mathematicians. In all, it contained 120 theorems. \\nHardy was stunned. He recalled that proving some of these theorems \\n\"defeated me completely.\" He recalled, \"I had never seen anything in \\nthe least like them before. A single look at them is enough to show that \\nthey could only be written down by a mathematician of the highest \\nclass.\"\" \\n\\nLittlewood and Hardy reached the identical astounding conclusion: \\nThis was obviously the work of a genius engaged in rederiving 100 years \\nof European mathematics. \"He had been carrying an impossible hand- \\nicap, a poor and solitary Hindu pitting his brains against the accumu- \\nlated wisdom of Europe,\" recalled Hardy.\" \\n\\nHardy sent for Ramanujan and, after much difficulty, arranged for \\nhis stay in Cambridge in 1914. For the first time, Ramanujan could com- \\nmunicate regularly with his peers, the community of European mathe- \\nmaticians. Then began a burst of activity: 3 short, intense years of col- \\nlaboration with Hardy at Trinity College in Cambridge. \\n\\nHardy later tried to estimate the mathematical skill that Ramanujan \\npossessed. He rated David Hilbert, universally recognized as one of the \\ngreatest Western mathematicians of the nineteenth century, an 80. To \\nRamanujan, he assigned a 100. (Hardy rated himself a 25.) \\n\\nUnfortunately, neither Hardy nor Ramanujan seemed interested in \\nthe psychology or thinking process by which Ramanujan discovered \\nthese incredible theorems, especially when this flood of material came \\npouring out of his \"dreams\" with such frequency. Hardy noted, \"It \\nseemed ridiculous to worry him about how he had found this or that \\nknown theorem, when he was showing me half a dozen new ones almost \\nevery day.\" 1 \\xe2\\x80\\x99 \\n\\nHardy vividly recalled, \\n\\n\\nI remember going to see him once when he was lying ill in Putney. I had \\nridden in taxi-cab No. 1729, and remarked that the number seemed to be \\n\\n\\n\\n176 \\n\\n\\nUNIFICATION IN TEN DIMENSIONS \\n\\n\\nrather a dull one, and that I hoped that it was not an unfavorable omen. \\n\"No,\" he replied, \"it is a very interesting number; it is the smallest number \\nexpressible as a sum of two cubes in two different ways.\\'\"\\xe2\\x80\\x99 \\n\\n(It is the sum of 1 X 1 X 1 and 12 X 12 X 12, and also the sum of 9 X \\n9X9 and 10 X 10 X 10.) On the spot, he could recite complex theorems \\nin arithmetic that would require a modern computer to prove. \\n\\nAlways in poor health, the austerity of the war-torn British economy \\nprevented Ramanujan from maintaining his strict vegetarian diet, and \\nhe was constantly in and out of sanitariums. After collaborating with \\nHardy for 3 years. Ramanujan fell ill and never recovered. World War I \\ninterrupted travel between England and India, and in 1919 he finally \\nmanaged to return home, where he died a year later. \\n\\n\\nModular Functions \\n\\nRamanujan\\'s legacy is his work, which consists of 4,000 formulas on 400 \\npages filling three volumes of notes, all densely packed with theorems \\nof incredible power but without any commentary or, which is more frus- \\ntrating, any proof. In 1976, however, a new discovery was made. One \\nhundred and thirty pages of scrap paper, containing the output of the \\nlast year of his life, was discovered by accident in a box at Trinity College. \\nThis is now called Ramanujan\\'s \"Lost Notebook.\" Commenting on the \\nLost Notebook, mathematician Richard Askey says, \"The work of that \\none year, while he was dying, was the equivalent of a lifetime of work for \\na very great mathematician. What he accomplished was unbelievable. If \\nit were a novel, nobody would believe it.\" To underscore the difficulty \\nof their arduous task of deciphering the \"notebooks,\" mathematicians \\nJonathan Borwein and Peter Borwein have commented, \"To our knowl- \\nedge no mathematical redaction of this scope or difficulty has ever been \\nattempted. \\n\\nLooking at the progression of Ramanujan\\'s equations, it\\'s as though \\nwe have been trained for years to listen to the Western music of Beetho- \\nven. and then suddenly we are exposed to another type of music, an \\neerily beautiful Eastern music blending harmonies and rhythms never \\nheard before in Western music. Jonathan Borwein says, \"He seems to \\nhave functioned in a way unlike anybody else we know of. He had such \\na feel for things that theyjust flowed out of his brain. Perhaps he didn\\'t \\nsee them in any way that\\'s translatable. It\\'s like watching somebody at a \\nfeast you haven\\'t been invited to.\" \\n\\n\\n\\nSuperstrings \\n\\n\\n[77 \\n\\n\\nAs physicists know, \"accidents\" do not appear without a reason. \\nWhen performing a long and difficult calculation, and then suddenly \\nhaving thousands of unwanted terms miraculously add up to zero, phys- \\nicists know that this does not happen without a deeper, underlying rea- \\nson. Today, physicists know that these \"accidents\" are an indication that \\na* symmetry is at work. For strings, the symmetry is called conformal \\nsymmetry, the symmetry of stretching and deforming the string\\'s world \\nsheet. \\n\\nThis is precisely where Ramanujan\\'s work comes in. In order to pro- \\ntect the original conformal symmetry from being destroyed by quantum \\ntheory, a number of mathematical identities must be miraculously sat- \\nisfied. These identities are precisely the identities of Ramanujan\\'s mod- \\nular function. \\n\\nIn summary, we have said that our fundamental premise is that the \\nlaws of nature simplify when expressed in higher dimensions. However, \\nin light of quantum theory, we must how amend this basic theme. The \\ncorrect statement should now read: The laws of nature simplify when \\nself-consistently expressed in higher dimensions. The addition of the word \\nself-consistently is crucial. This constraint forces us to use Ramanujan\\'s \\nmodular functions, which fixes the dimension of space-time to be ten. \\nThis, in turn, may give us the decisive clue to explain the origin of the \\nuniverse. \\n\\nEinstein often asked himself whether God had any choice in creating \\nthe universe. According to superstring theorists, once we demand a uni- \\nfication of quantum theory and general relativity, God had no choice. \\nSelf-consistency alone, they claim, must have forced God to create the \\nuniverse as he did. \\n\\nAlthough the mathematical sophistication introduced by superstring \\ntheory has reached dizzying heights and has startled the mathematicians, \\nthe critics of the theory still pound it at its weakest point. Any theory, \\nthey claim, must be testable. Since any theory defined at the Planck \\nenergy of 10\\xe2\\x80\\x9c billion electron volts is not testable, superstring theory is \\nnot really a theory at all! \\n\\nThe main problem, as we have pointed out, is theoretical rather than \\nexperimental. Ifwe were smart enough, we could solve the theory exactly \\nand find the true nonperturbative solution of the theory. However, this \\ndoes not excuse us from finding some means by which to verify the \\ntheory experimentally. To test the theory, we must wait for signals from \\nthe tenth dimension. \\n\\n\\n\\n8 \\n\\nSignals from \\nthe Tenth Dimension \\n\\n\\nHow strange it would be if the final theory were to be discov- \\nered in our lifetimes! The discovery of the final laws of nature \\nwill mark a discontinuity in human intellectual history, the \\nsharpest that has occurred since the beginning of modern sci- \\nence in the seventeenth century. Can we now imagine what \\nthat would be like? \\n\\nSteven Weinberg \\n\\n\\nIs Beauty a Physical Principle? \\n\\n\\nA LTHOUGH superstring theory gives us a compelling formulation \\nof the theory of the universe, the fundamental problem is that an \\nexperimental test of the theory seems beyond our present-day technol- \\nogy. In fact, the theory predicts that the unification of all forces occurs \\nat the Planck energy, or 10\\'\" billion electron volts, which is about 1 \\nquadrillion times larger than energies currently available in our accel- \\nerators. \\n\\nPhysicist David Gross, commenting on the cost of generating this \\nfantastic energy, says, \"There is not enough money in the treasuries of \\nall the countries in the world put together. It\\'s truly astronomical.\\'\" \\n\\nThis is disappointing, because it means that experimental verifica- \\ntion, the engine that drives progress in physics, is no longer possible with \\nour current generation of machines or with any generation of machines \\n\\n\\n178 \\n\\n\\n\\nSignals from the Tenth Dimension \\n\\n\\n179 \\n\\n\\nin the conceivable future. This, in turn, means that the ten-dimensional \\ntheory is not a theory in the usual sense, because it is untestable given \\nthe present technological state of our planet. We are then left with the \\nquestion: Is beauty, by itself, a physical principle that can be substituted \\nfor the lack of experimental verification? \\n\\nTo some, the answer is a resounding no. They derisively call these \\ntheories \"theatrical physics\" or \"recreational mathematics.\" The most \\ncaustic of the critics is Nobel Prize winner Sheldon Glashow of Harvard \\nUniversity. He has assumed the role of gadfly in this debate, leading the \\ncharge against the claims of other physicists that higher dimensions may \\nexist. Glashow rails against these physicists, comparing the current epi- \\ndemic to the AIDS virus; that is, it\\'s incurable. He also compares the \\ncurrent bandwagon effect with former President Reagan\\'s Star Wars pro- \\ngram: \\n\\n\\nHere\\'s a riddle: Name two grand designs that are incredibly complex, \\nrequire decades of research to develop, and may never work in the real \\nworld? Stars Wars and string theory. . . . Neither ambition can be accom- \\nplished with existing technology, and neither may achieve its stated objec- \\ntives. Both adventures are costly in terms of scarce human resources. And, \\nin both cases, the Russians are trying desperately to catch up . 2 \\n\\nTo stir up more controversy, Glashow even penned a poem, which \\nends: \\n\\n\\nThe Theory of Everything, if you dare to be bold, \\n\\nMight be something more than a string orbifold. \\n\\nWhile some of your leaders have got old and sclerotic, \\n\\nNot to be trusted alone with things heterotic, \\n\\nPlease heed our advice that you are not smitten \\xe2\\x80\\x94 \\n\\nThe Book is not finished, the last word is not Witten . 3 \\n\\nGlashow has vowed (unsuccessfully) to keep these theories out of Har- \\nvard, where he teaches. But he does admit that he is often outnumbered \\non this question. He regrets, \"I find myself a dinosaur in a world of \\nupstart mammals .\" 4 (Glashow\\'s views are certainly not shared by other \\nNobel laureates, such as Murray Gell-Mann and Steven Weinberg. Phys- \\nicist Weinberg, in fact, says, \"String theory provides our only present \\nsource of candidates for a final theory \\xe2\\x80\\x94 how could anyone expect that \\nmany of the brightest young theorists would not work on it?\" 5 ) \\n\\nTo understand the implications of this debate concerning the uni- \\n\\n\\n\\n180 \\n\\n\\nUNIFICATION IN TEN DIMENSIONS \\n\\n\\nfication of all forces, and also the problems with its experimental veri- \\nfication, it is instructive to consider the following analogy, the \"parable \\nof the gemstone. \" \\n\\nIn the beginning, let us say, was a gemstone of great beauty, which \\nwas perfectly symmetrical in three dimensions. However, this gemstone \\nwas unstable. One day, it burst apart and sent fragments in all directions; \\nthey eventually rained down on the two-dimensional world of Flatland. \\nCurious, the residents of Flatland embarked on a quest to reassemble \\nthe pieces. They called the original explosion the Big Bang, but did not \\nunderstand why these fragments were scattered throughout their world. \\nEventually, two kinds of fragments were identified. Some fragments were \\npolished and smooth on one side, and Flatlanders compared them to \\n\"marble.\" Other fragments were entirely jagged and ugly, with no reg- \\nularity whatsoever, and Flatlanders compared these pieces to \"wood.\" \\n\\nOver the years, the Flatlanders divided into two camps. The first \\ncamp began to piece together the polished fragments. Slowly, some of \\nthe polished pieces begin to fit together. Marveling at how these pol- \\nished fragments were being assembled, these Flatlanders were convinced \\nthat somehow a powerful new geometry must be operating. These Flat- \\nlanders called their partially assembled piece \"relativity.\" \\n\\nThe second group devoted their efforts to assembling the jagged, \\nirregular fragments. They, too, had limited success in finding patterns \\namong these fragments. However, the jagged pieces produced only a \\nlarger but even more irregular clump, which they called the Standard \\nModel. No one was inspired by the ugly mass called the Standard Model. \\n\\nAfter years of painstaking work trying to fit these various pieces \\ntogether, however, it appeared as though there was no way to put the \\npolished pieces together with thejagged pieces. \\n\\nThen one day an ingenious Flatlander hit upon a marvelous idea. \\nHe declared that the two sets of pieces could be reassembled into one \\npiece if they were moved \"up\" \\xe2\\x80\\x94 that is, in something he called the third \\ndimension. Most Flatlanders were bewildered by this new approach, \\nbecause no one could understand what \"up\" meant. However, he was \\nable to show by computer that the \"marble\" fragments could be viewed \\nas outer fragments of some object, and were hence polished, while the \\n\"wood\" fragments were the inner fragments. When both sets of frag- \\nments were assembled in the third dimension, the Flatlanders gasped at \\nwhat was revealed in the computer: a dazzling gemstone with perfect \\nthree-dimensional symmetry. In one stroke, the artificial distinction \\nbetween the two sets of fragments was resolved by pure geometry. \\n\\nThis solution, however, left several questions unanswered. Some Flat- \\n\\n\\n\\nSignals from the Tenth Dimension \\n\\n\\n181 \\n\\n\\nlanders still wanted experimental proof, not just theoretical calculations, \\nthat the pieces could really be assembled into this gemstone. This theory \\ngave a concrete number for the energy it would take to build powerful \\nmachines that could hoist these fragments \"up\" offFlatland and assem- \\nble the pieces in three-dimensional space. But the energy required was \\nabout a quadrillion times the largest energy source available to the Flat- \\nlanders. \\n\\nFor some, the theoretical calculation was sufficient. Even lacking \\nexperimental verification, they felt that \"beauty\" was more than suffi- \\ncient to settle the question of unification. History had always shown, they \\npointed out, that the solution to the most difficult problems in nature \\nhad been the ones with the most beauty. They also correctly pointed out \\nthat the three-dimensional theory had no rival. \\n\\nOther Fladanders, however, raised a howl. A theory that cannot be \\ntested is not a theory, they fumed. Testing this theory would drain the \\nbest minds and waste valuable resources on a wild-goose chase, they \\nclaimed. \\n\\nThe debate in Flatland, as well as in the real world, will persist for \\nsome time, which is a good thing. As the eighteenth-century philosopher \\nJoseph Joubert once said, \"It is better to debate a question without set- \\ntling it than to settle a question without debating it.\" \\n\\n\\nThe Superconducting Supercollider: Window on Creation \\n\\nThe eighteenth-century English philosopher David Hume, who was \\nfamous for advancing the thesis that every theory must be grounded on \\nthe foundation of experiment, was at a loss to explain how one can \\nexperimentally verify a theory of Creation. The essence of experiment, \\nhe claimed, is reproducibility. Unless an experiment can be duplicated \\nover and over, in different locations and at different times with the same \\nresults, the theory is unreliable. But how can one perform an experiment \\nwith Creation itself? Since Creadon, by definition, is not a reproducible \\nevent, Hume had to conclude that it is impossible to verify any theory \\nof Creation. Science, he claimed, can answer almost all questions con- \\ncerning the universe except for one. Creation, the only experiment that \\ncannot be reproduced. \\n\\nIn some sense, we are encountering a modern version of the problem \\nidentified by Hume in the eighteenth century. The problem remains \\nthe same: The energy necessary to re-create Creation exceeds anything \\navailable on the planet earth. However, although direct experimental \\n\\n\\n\\n182 \\n\\n\\nUNIFICATION IN TEN DIMENSIONS \\n\\n\\nverification of the ten-dimensional theory in our laboratories is not pos- \\nsible, there are several ways to approach this question indirectly. The \\nmost logical approach was to hope that the superconducting supercol- \\nlider (SSC) would find subatomic particles that show the distinctive sig- \\nnature of the superstring, such as supersymmetry. Although the SSC \\ncould not have probed the Planck energy, it might have given us strong, \\nindirect evidence of the correctness of superstring theory. \\n\\nThe SSC (killed off by formidable political opposition) would have \\nbeen a truly monstrous machine, the last of its type. When completed \\noutside Dallas, Texas, around the year 2000, it would have consisted of \\na gigantic tube 50 miles in circumference surrounded by huge magnets. \\n(If it were centered in Manhattan, it would have extended well into \\nConnecticut and NewJersey.) Over 3,000 full-time and visiting scientists \\nand staff would have conducted experiments and analyzed the data from \\nthe machine. \\n\\nThe purpose of the SSC was to whip two beams of protons around \\ninside this tube until they reached a velocity very close to the speed of \\nlight. Because these beams would be traveling clockwise and counter- \\nclockwise, it would have been a simple matter to make them collide \\nwithin the tube when they reached their maximum energy. The protons \\nwould have smashed into one another at an energy of 40 trillion electron \\nvolts (TeV), thereby generating an intense burst of subatomic debris \\nanalyzed by detectors. This kind of collision has not occurred since the \\nBig Bang itself (hence the nickname for the SSC: \"window on crea- \\ntion\"). Among the debris, physicists hoped to find exotic subatomic \\nparticles that would have shed light on the ultimate form of matter. \\n\\nNot surprisingly, the SSC was an extraordinary engineering and phys- \\nics project, stretching the limits of known technology. Because the mag- \\nnetic fields necessary to bend the protons and antiprotons within the \\ntube are so exceptionally large (on the order of 100,000 times the earth\\'s \\nmagnetic field), extraordinary procedures would have been necessary to \\ngenerate and maintain them. For example, to reduce the heating and \\nelectrical resistance within the wires, the magnets would have been \\ncooled down nearly to absolute zero. Then they would have been spe- \\ncially reinforced because the magnetic fields are so intense that other- \\nwise they would have warped the metal of the magnet itself. \\n\\nProjected to cost $11 billion, the SSC became a prized plum and a \\nmatter of intense political jockeying. In the past, the sites for atom \\nsmashers were decided by unabashed political horse trading. For exam- \\nple, the state of Illinois was able to land the Fermilab accelerator in \\nBatavia, just outside Chicago, because (according to Physics Today ) Pres- \\n\\n\\n\\nSignals from the Tenth Dimension \\n\\n\\n183 \\n\\n\\nident Lyndon Johnson needed Illinois senator Everett Dirkson\\'s crucial \\nvote on the Vietnam War. The SSC was probably no different. Although \\nmany states vigorously competed for the project, it probably came as no \\nsurprise that in 1988 the great state of Texas landed the SSC, especially \\nwhen both the president-elect of the United States and the Democratic \\nvice-presidential candidate came from Texas. \\n\\nAlthough billions of dollars have been spent on the SSC, it will never \\nbe completed. To the horror of the physics community, the House of \\nRepresentatives voted in 1993 to cancel the project completely. Intense \\nlobbying failed to restore funding for the project. To Congress, an \\nexpensive atom smasher can be seen in two ways. It can be a juicy plum, \\ngenerating thousands of jobs and billions of dollars in federal subsidies \\nfor the state that has it. Or it can be viewed as an incredible boondoggle, \\na waste of money that generates no direct consumer benefits. In lean \\ntimes, they argue, an expensive toy for high-energy physicists is a luxury \\nthe country cannot afford. (In all fairness, though, funding for the SSC \\nproject must be put into proper perspective. Star Wars funding forjust \\n1 year costs $4 billion. It costs about $1 billion to refurbish an aircraft \\ncarrier. A single space-shuttle mission costs $1 billion. And a single B-2 \\nstealth bomber costs almost $1 billion.) \\n\\nAlthough the SSC is dead, what might we have discovered with it? At \\nthe very least, scientists hoped to find exotic particles, such as the mys- \\nterious Higgs particle predicted by the Standard Model. It is the Higgs \\nparticle that generates symmetry breaking and is therefore the origin of \\nthe mass of the quarks. Thus we hoped that the SSC would have found \\nthe \"origin of mass.\" All objects surrounding us that have weight owe \\ntheir mass to the Higgs particle. \\n\\nThe betting among physicists, however, was that there was an even \\nchance that the SSC would find exotic particles beyond the Standard \\nModel. (Possibilities included \"Technicolor\" particles, which lie just \\nbeyond the Standard Model, or \"axions,\" which may help to explain \\nthe dark matter problem.) But perhaps the most exciting possibility was \\nthe sparticles, which are the supersymmetric partners of ordinary par- \\nticles. The gravitino, for example, is the supersymmetric partner of the \\ngraviton. The supersymmetric partners of the quark and lepton, respec- \\ntively, are the squark and the slepton. \\n\\nIf supersymmetric particles are eventually discovered, then there is a \\nfighting chance that we will be seeing the remnants of the superstring \\nitself. (Supersymmetry, as a symmetry of a field theory, was first discov- \\nered in superstring theory in 1971, even before the discovery of super- \\ngravity. In fact, the superstring is probably the only theory in which \\n\\n\\n\\n184 \\n\\n\\nUNIFICATION IN TEN DIMENSIONS \\n\\n\\nsupersymmetry and gravity can be combined in a totally self-consistent \\nway.) And even though the potential discovery ofsparticles will not prove \\nthe correctness of superstring theory, it will help to quiet the skeptics \\nwho have said that there is not one shred of physical evidence for \\nsuperstring theory. \\n\\n\\nSignals from Outer Space \\n\\nSince the SSC will never be built, and hence will never detect particles \\nthat are low-energy resonances of the superstring, then another possi- \\nbility is to measure the energy of cosmic rays, which are highly energetic \\nsubatomic particles whose origin is still unknown, but must lie deep in \\nouter space beyond our galaxy. For example, although no one knows \\nwhere they come from, cosmic rays have energies much larger than any- \\nthing found in our laboratories. \\n\\nCosmic rays, unlike the controlled rays produced in atom smashers, \\nhave unpredictable energies and cannot produce precise energies on \\ndemand. In some sense, it\\'s like trying to put out a fire by either using \\nhose water or waiting for a rainstorm. The hose water is much more \\nconvenient: We can turn it on any time we please, we can adjust the \\nintensity of the water at will, and all the water travels at the same uniform \\nvelocity. Water from a fire hydrant therefore corresponds to producing \\ncontrolled beams in atom smashers. However, water from a rainstorm \\nmay be much more intense and effective than water from a fire hydrant. \\nThe problem, of course, is that rainstorms, like cosmic rays, are unpre- \\ndictable. You cannot regulate the rainwater, nor can you predict its veloc- \\nity, which may fluctuate wildly. \\n\\nCosmic rays were first discovered 80 years ago in experiments per- \\nformed by the Jesuit priest Theodor Wulf atop the Eiffel Tower in Paris. \\nFrom the 1900s to the 1930s, courageous physicists sailed in balloons or \\nscaled mountains to obtain the best measurements of cosmic rays. But \\ncosmic-ray research began to fade during the 1930s, when Ernest Law- \\nrence invented the cyclotron and produced controlled beams in the \\nlaboratory more energetic than most cosmic rays. For example, cosmic \\nrays, which are as energetic as 100 million electron volts, are as common \\nas rain drops; they hit the atmosphere of the earth at the rate of a few \\nper square inch per second. However, Lawrence\\'s invention spawned \\ngiant machines that could exceed that energy by a factor of 10 to 100. \\n\\nCosmic-ray experiments, fortunately, have changed dramatically \\nsince Father Wulf first placed electrified jars on the Eiffel Tower. Rockets \\n\\n\\n\\nSignals from the Tenth Dimension \\n\\n\\n185 \\n\\n\\nand even satellites can now send radiation counters high above the \\nearth\\'s surface, so that atmospheric effects are minimized. When a \\nhighly energetic cosmic ray strikes the atmosphere, it shatters the atoms \\nin its wake. These fragments, in turn, create a shower of broken atoms, \\nor ions, which can then be detected on the ground by this series of \\ndetectors. A collaboration between the University of Chicago and the \\nUniversity of Michigan has inaugurated the most ambitious cosmic-ray \\nproject yet, a vast array of 1,089 detectors scattered over about a square \\nmile of desert, waiting for the cosmic-ray showers to trigger them. These \\ndetectors are located in an ideal, isolated area: the Dugway Proving \\nGrounds, 80 miles southwest of Salt Lake City, Utah. \\n\\nThe Utah detector is sensitive enough to identify the point of origin \\nof some of the most energetic cosmic rays. So far, Cygnus X-3 and Her- \\ncules X-l have been identified as powerful cosmic-ray emitters. They are \\nprobably large, spinning neutron stars, or even black holes, that are \\nslowly eating up a companion star, creating a large vortex of energy and \\nspewing gigantic quantities of radiation (for example, protons) into \\nouter space. \\n\\nSo far, the most energetic cosmic ray ever detected had an energy of \\n10 ! \\xe2\\x80\\x9d electron volts. This figure is an incredible 10 million times the \\nenergy that would have been produced in the SSC. We do not expect to \\ngenerate energies approaching this cosmic energy with our machines \\nwithin the century. Although this fantastic energy is still 100 million \\ntimes smaller than the energy necessary to probe the tenth dimension, \\nwe hope that energies produced deep within black holes in our galaxy \\nwill approach the Planck energy. With large, orbiting spacecraft, we \\nshould be able to probe deeper into the structure of these energy sources \\nand detect energies even larger than this. \\n\\nAccording to one favored theory, the largest energy source within \\nour Milky Way galaxy \\xe2\\x80\\x94 far beyond anything produced by Cygnus X-3 or \\nHercules X-l \\xe2\\x80\\x94 lies at the center, which may consist of millions of black \\nholes. So, because the SSC was canceled by Congress, we may find that \\nthe ultimate probe for exploring the tenth dimension may lie in outer \\nspace. \\n\\n\\nTesting the Untestable \\n\\n\\nHistorically speaking, there have been many times when physicists have \\nsolemnly declared certain phenomena to be \"untestable\" or \"unprov- \\nable.\" But there is another attitude that scientists can take concerning \\n\\n\\n\\n186 \\n\\n\\nUNIFICATION IN TEN DIMENSIONS \\n\\n\\nthe inaccessibility of the Planck energy \\xe2\\x80\\x94 unforeseen breakthroughs will \\nmake indirect experiments possible near the Planck energy. \\n\\nIn the nineteenth century, some scientists declared that the com- \\nposition of the stars would forever be beyond the reach of experiment. \\nIn 1825, the French philosopher and social critic Auguste Comte, writing \\nin Cours de philosophic, declared that we would never know the stars other \\nthan as unreachable points of light in the sky because of their enormous \\ndistance from us. The machines of the nineteenth century, or any cen- \\ntury, he argued, were not powerful enough to escape from the earth and \\nreach the stars. \\n\\nAlthough determining what the stars were made of seemed beyond \\nthe capabilities of any science, ironically at almost the same time, the \\nGerman physicist Joseph von Fraunhofer was doing just that. Using a \\nprism and spectroscope, he could separate the white light emitted from \\nthe distant stars and determine the chemical composition of those stars. \\nSince each chemical within the stars emits a characteristic \"fingerprint,\" \\nor spectrum of light, it was easy for Fraunhofer to perform the \"impos- \\nsible\" and to determine that hydrogen is the most abundant element in \\nthe stars. \\n\\nThis, in turn, inspired poet Ian D. Bush to write: \\n\\nTwinkle, twinkle little star \\nI don\\'t wonder what you are, \\n\\nFor by spectroscopic ken, \\n\\nI know that you are hydrogen.\\' \\n\\nThus although the energy necessary to reach the stars via rockets was far \\nbeyond anything available to Comte (or, for that matter, anything avail- \\nable to modern science), the crucial step did not involve energy. The \\nkey observation was that signals from the stars, rather than direct mea- \\nsurement, were sufficient to solve the problem. Similarly, we can hope \\nthat signals from the Planck energy (perhaps from cosmic rays or per- \\nhaps an as yet unknown source), rather than a direct measurement from \\nlarge atom smashers, may be sufficient to probe the tenth \\ndimension. \\n\\nAnother example of an \"untestable\" idea was the existence ofatoms. \\nIn the nineteenth century, the atomic hypothesis proved to be the deci- \\nsive step in understanding the laws of chemistry and thermodynamics. \\nHowever, many physicists refused to believe that atoms actually exist. \\nPerhaps they werejust a mathematical device that, by accident, gave the \\ncorrect description of the world. For example, the philosopher Ernst \\n\\n\\n\\nSignals from the Tenth Dimension \\n\\n\\n187 \\n\\n\\nMach did not believe in the existence of atoms, other than as a calcu- \\nlational tool. (Even today, we are still unable to take direct pictures of \\nthe atom because of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, although \\nindirect methods now exist.) In 1905, however, Einstein gave the most \\nconvincing, although indirect, evidence of the existence of atoms when \\nhe showed that Brownian motion (that is, the random motion of dust \\nparticles suspended in a liquid) can be explained as random collisions \\nbetween the particles and atoms in the liquid. \\n\\nBy analogy, we might hope for experimental confirmation of the \\nphysics of the tenth dimension using indirect methods that have not yet \\nbeen discovered. Instead of photographing the object we desire, perhaps \\nwe should be satisfied with a photograph of its \"shadow. \" The indirect \\napproach would be to examine carefully low-energy data from an atom \\nsmasher, and try to see if ten-dimensional physics affects the data in some \\nway. \\n\\nThe third \"untestable\" idea in physics was the existence of the elu- \\nsive neutrino. \\n\\nIn 1930, physicist Wolfgang Pauli hypothesized a new, unseen parti- \\ncle called the neutrino in order to account for the missing component \\nof energy in certain experiments on radioactivity that seemed to violate \\nthe conservation of matter and energy. Pauli realized, though, that neu- \\ntrinos would be almost impossible to observe experimentally, because \\nthey would interact so weakly, and hence so rarely, with matter. For \\nexample, ifwe could construct a solid block of lead that stretched several \\nlight-years from our solar system to Alpha Centauri and placed it in the \\npath of a beam of neutrinos, some would still come out the other end. \\nThey can penetrate the earth as though it doesn\\'t even exist, and, in \\nfact, trillions of neutrinos emitted from the sun are always penetrating \\nyour body, even at night. Pauli admitted, \"I have committed the ultimate \\nsin, I have predicted the existence of a particle that can never be \\nobserved. \" \\n\\nSo elusive and undetectable was the neutrino that it even inspired a \\npoem byjohn Updike, called \"Cosmic Gall\": \\n\\nNeutrinos, they are very small. \\n\\nThey have no charge and have no mass \\nAnd do not interact at all. \\n\\nThe earth isjust a silly ball \\nTo them, through which they simply pass, \\n\\nLike dustmaids down a drafty hall \\nOr photons though a sheet of glass. \\n\\nThey snub the most exquisite gas, \\n\\n\\n\\n188 \\n\\n\\nUNIFICATION IN TEN DIMENSIONS \\n\\n\\nIgnore the most substantial wall, \\n\\nCold-shoulder steel and sounding brass, \\n\\nInsult the stallion in his stall, \\n\\nAnd scorning barriers of class, \\n\\nInfiltrate you and me! Like tall \\nAnd painless guillotines, they fall \\nDown through our heads into the grass. \\n\\nAt night, they enter at Nepal \\nAnd pierce the lover and his lass \\n\\nFrom underneath the bed \\xe2\\x80\\x94 you call \\nIt wonderful; I call it crass. 8 \\n\\nAlthough the neutrino, because it barely interacts with other mate- \\nrials, was once considered the ultimate \"untestable\" idea, today we reg- \\nularly produce beams of neutrinos in atom smashers, perform experi- \\nments with the neutrinos emitted from a nuclear reactor, and detect \\ntheir presence within mines far below the earth\\'s surface. (In fact, when \\na spectacular supernova lit up the sky in the southern hemisphere in \\n1987, physicists noticed a burst of neutrinos streaming through their \\ndetectors deep in these mines. This was the first time that neutrino detec- \\ntors were used to make crucial astronomical measurements.) Neutrinos, \\nin 3 short decades, have been transformed from an \"untestable\" idea \\ninto one of the workhorses of modern physics. \\n\\n\\nThe Problem Is Theoretical, Not Experimental \\n\\nTaking the long view on the history of science, perhaps there is some \\ncause for optimism. Witten is convinced that science will some day be \\nable to probe down to Planck energies. He says. \\n\\nIt\\'s not always so easy to tell which are the easy questions and which are \\nthe hard ones. In the 19th century, the question of why water boils at 100 \\ndegrees was hopelessly inaccessible. Ifyou told a 19th-century physicist that \\nby the 20th century you would be able to calculate this, it would have \\nseemed like a fairy tale. . . . Quantum field theory is so difficult that nobody \\nfully believed it for 25 years. \\n\\nIn his view, \"good ideas always get tested.\"\\xe2\\x80\\x99 \\n\\nThe astronomer Arthur Eddington even questioned whether scien- \\ntists were not overstating the case when they insisted that everything \\nshould be tested. He wrote: \"A scientist commonly professes to base his \\n\\n\\n\\nSignals from the Tenth Dimension \\n\\n\\n189 \\n\\n\\nbeliefs on observations, not theories. ... I have never come across any- \\none who carries this profession into practice. . . . Observation is not suf- \\nficient . . . theory has an important share in determining belief.\" 1 \" Nobel \\nlaureate Paul Dirac said it even more bluntly, \"It is more important to \\nhave beauty in one\\'s equations than to have them fit experiment.\"\" Or, \\nin the words of CERN physicist John Ellis, \"in the words of a candy \\nwrapper I opened a few years ago: \\'It is only the optimists who achieve \\nanything in this world.\\' \" Nonetheless, despite arguments that uphold a \\ncertain degree of optimism, the experimental situation looks bleak. I \\nshare, along with the skeptics, the idea that the best we can hope for is \\nindirect tests of ten-dimensional theory into the twenty-first century. This \\nis because, in the final analysis, this theory is a theory of Creation, and \\nhence testing it necessarily involves re-creating a piece of the Big Bang \\nin our laboratories. \\n\\nPersonally, I don\\'t think that we have to wait a century until our \\naccelerators, space probes, and cosmic-ray counters will be powerful \\nenough to probe the tenth dimension indirectly. Within a span of years, \\nand certainly within the lifetime of today\\'s physicists, someone will be \\nclever enough to either verify or disprove the ten-dimensional theory by \\nsolving the field theory of strings or some other nonperturbative for- \\nmulation. The problem is thus theoretical, not experimental. \\n\\nAssuming that some bright physicist solves the field theory of strings \\nand derives the known properties of our universe, there is still the prac- \\ntical problem of when we might be able to harness the power of the \\nhyperspace theory. There are two possibilities: \\n\\n1. Wait until our civilization attains the ability to master energies \\ntrillions of times larger than anything we can produce today \\n\\n2. Encounter extraterrestrial civilizations that have mastered the \\nart of manipulating hyperspace \\n\\nWe recall that it took about 70 years, between the work of Faraday \\nand Maxwell to the work of Edison and his co-workers, to exploit the \\nelectromagnetic force for practical purposes. Yet modern civilization \\ndepends crucially on the harnessing of this force. The nuclear force was \\ndiscovered near the turn of the century, and 80 years later we still do \\nnot have the means to harness it successfully with fusion reactors. The \\nnext leap, to harness the power of the unified field theory, requires a \\nmuch greater jump in our technology, but one that will probably have \\nvastly more important implications. \\n\\nThe fundamental problem is that we are forcing superstring theory \\n\\n\\n\\n190 \\n\\n\\nUNIFICATION IN TEN DIMENSIONS \\n\\n\\nto answer questions about everyday energies, when its \"natural home\" \\nlies at the Planck energy. This fabulous energy was released only at the \\ninstant of Creation itself. In other words, superstring theory is naturally \\na theory of Creation. Like the caged cheetah, we are demanding that \\nthis superb animal dance and sing for our entertainment. The real home \\nof the cheetah is the vast plains of Africa. The real \"home\" of superstr- \\ning theory is the instant of Creation. Nevertheless, given the sophisti- \\ncation of our artificial satellites, there is perhaps one last \"laboratory\" \\nin which we may experimentally probe the natural home of superstring \\ntheory, and this is the echo of Creation! \\n\\n\\n\\n9 \\n\\nBefore Creation \\n\\n\\nIn the beginning, was the great cosmic egg. Inside the egg was \\nchaos, and floating in chaos was P\\'an Ku, the divine Embryo. \\n\\nP\\'an Ku myth (China, third century) \\n\\n\\nIf God created the world, where was He before Creation? . . . \\nKnow that the world is uncreated, as time itself is, without \\nbeginning and end. \\n\\nMahapurana (India, ninth century) \\n\\n\\nii nv id God have a mother?\" \\n\\nL/ Children, when told that God made the heavens and the \\n\\nearth, innocently ask whether God had a mother. This deceptively sim- \\nple question has stumped the elders of the church and embarrassed the \\nfinest theologians, precipitating some of the thorniest theological \\ndebates over the centuries. All the great religions have elaborate mythol- \\nogies surrounding the divine act of Creation, but none of them ade- \\nquately confronts the logical paradoxes inherent in the questions that \\neven children ask. \\n\\nGod may have created the heavens and the earth in 7 days, but what \\nhappened before the first day? If one concedes that God had a mother, \\nthen one naturally asks whether she, too, had a mother, and so on, \\nforever. However, if God did not have a mother, then this answer raises \\neven more questions: Where did God come from? Was God always in \\nexistence since eternity, or is God beyond time itself? \\n\\n\\n191 \\n\\n\\n\\n192 \\n\\n\\nUNIFICATION IN TEN DIMENSIONS \\n\\n\\nOver the centuries, even great painters commissioned by the church \\ngrappled with these ticklish theological debates in their works of art: \\nWhen depicting God or Adam and Eve, do you give them belly buttons? \\nSince the navel marks the point of attachment of the umbilical cord, \\nthen neither God nor Adam and Eve could be painted with belly buttons. \\nFor example, Michelangelo faced this dilemma in his celebrated depic- \\ntion of Creation and the expulsion of Adam and Eve from the Garden \\nof Eden when he painted the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel. The answer \\nto this theological question is to be found hanging in any large museum: \\nGod and Adam and Eve simply have no belly buttons, because they were \\nthe first. \\n\\n\\nProofs of the Existence of God \\n\\nTroubled by the inconsistencies in church ideology, St. Thomas Aquinas, \\nwriting in the thirteenth century, decided to raise the level of theological \\ndebate from the vagueness of mythology to the rigor of logic. He pro- \\nposed to solve these ancient questions in his celebrated \"proofs of the \\nexistence of God. \" \\n\\nAquinas summarized his proofs in the following poem: \\n\\nThings are in motion, hence there is a first mover \\nThings are caused, hence there is a first cause \\nThings exist, hence there is a creator \\nPerfect goodness exists, hence it has a source \\nThings are designed, hence they serve a purpose.\\' \\n\\n(The first three lines are variations of what is called the cosmological proof ; \\nthe fourth argues on moral grounds; and the fifth is called the teleological \\nproof. The moral proof is by far the weakest, because morality can be \\nviewed in terms of evolving social customs.) \\n\\nAquinas\\'s \"cosmological\" and \"teleological\" proofs of the existence \\nof God have been used by the church for the past 700 years to answer \\nthis sticky theological question. Although these proofs have since been \\nshown to be flawed in light of the scientific discoveries made over the \\npast 7 centuries, they were quite ingenious for their time and show the \\ninfluence of the Greeks, who were the first to introduce rigor into their \\nspeculations about nature. \\n\\nAquinas began the cosmological proof by postulating that God was \\nthe First Mover and First Maker. He artfully dodged the question of \\n\\n\\n\\nBefore Creation \\n\\n\\n198 \\n\\n\\n\"who made God\" by simply asserting that the question made no sense. \\nGod had no maker because he was the First. Period. The cosmological \\nproof states that everything that moves must have had something push \\nit, which in turn must have had something push it, and so on. But what \\nstarted the first push? \\n\\nImagine, for the moment, idly sitting in the park and seeing a wagon \\nmoving in front of you. Obviously, you think, there is a young child \\npushing the wagon. You wait a moment, only to find another wagon \\npushing the first wagon. Curious, you wait a bit longer for the child, but \\nthere is a third wagon pushing the first two wagons. As time goes by, you \\nwitness hundreds ofwagons, each one pushing the others, with no child \\nin sight. Puzzled, you look out into the distance. You are surprised to \\nsee an infinite sequence of wagons stretching into the horizon, each \\nwagon pushing the others, with no child at all. If it takes a child to push \\na wagon, then can an infinite sequence of wagons be pushed without \\nthe First Pusher? Can an infinite sequence of wagons push itself? No. \\nTherefore, God must exist. \\n\\nThe teleological proof is even more persuasive. It states that there \\nhas to be a First Designer. For example, imagine walking on the sands \\nof Mars, where the winds and dust storms have worn even the mountains \\nand giant craters. Over tens of millions of years, nothing has escaped \\nthe corrosive, grinding effect of the sand storms. Then, to your surprise, \\nyou find a beautiful camera lying in the sand dunes. The lens is smoothly \\npolished and the shutter mechanism delicately crafted. Surely, you \\nthink, the sands of Mars could not have created such a beautiful piece \\nof craftsmanship. You conclude that someone intelligent obviously made \\nthis camera. Then, after wandering on the surface of Mars some more, \\nyou come across a rabbit. Obviously, the eye of the rabbit is infinitely \\nmore intricate than the eye of the camera. The muscles of the rabbit\\'s \\neye are infinitely more elaborate than the shutter of the camera. \\nTherefore, the maker of this rabbit must be infinitely more advanced \\nthan the maker of the camera. This maker must therefore be \\nGod. \\n\\nNow imagine the machines on the earth. There is no question that \\nthese machines were made by something even greater, such as humans. \\nThere is no question that a human is infinitely more complicated than \\na machine. Therefore, the person who created us must be infinitely more \\ncomplicated than we are. So therefore God must exist. \\n\\nIn 1078, St. Anselm, the archbishop of Canterbury, cooked up per- \\nhaps the most sophisticated proof of the existence of God, the ontological \\nproof, which does not depend on First Movers or First Designers at all. \\n\\n\\n\\n194 \\n\\n\\nUNIFICATION IN TEN DIMENSIONS \\n\\n\\nSt. Anselm claimed that he could prove the existence of God from pure \\nlogic alone. He defined God as the most perfect, most powerful being \\nimaginable. It is, however, possible to conceive of two types of God. The \\nfirst God, we imagine, does not exist. The second God, we imagine, \\nactually does exist and can perform miracles, such as parting the \\nrivers and raising the dead. Obviously, the second God (who exists) is \\nmore powerful and more perfect than the first God (who does not \\nexist). \\n\\nHowever, we defined God to be the most perfect and powerful being \\nimaginable. By the definition of God, the second God (who exists) is the \\nmore powerful and more perfect one. Therefore, the second God is the \\none who fits the definition. The first God (who does not exist) is weaker \\nand less perfect than the second God, and therefore does not fit the \\ndefinition of God. Hence God must exist. In other words, if we define \\nGod as \"that being nothing greater than which can be conceived,\" then \\nGod must exist because if he didn\\'t, it\\'s possible to conceive of a much \\ngreater God who does exist. This rather ingenious proof, unlike those \\nof St. Thomas Aquinas, is totally independent of the act of Creation and \\nrests solely on the definition of the perfect being. \\n\\nRemarkably, these \"proofs\" of the existence of God lasted for over \\n700 years, defying the repeated challenges of scientists and logicians. \\nThe reason for this is that not enough was known about the fundamental \\nlaws of physics and biology. In fact, only within the past century have \\nnew laws of nature been discovered that can isolate the potential flaws \\nin these proofs. \\n\\nThe flaw in the cosmological proof, for example, is that the conser- \\nvation of mass and energy is sufficient to explain motion without appeal- \\ning to a First Mover. For example, gas molecules may bounce against \\nthe walls of a container without requiring anyone or anything to get \\nthem moving. In principle, these molecules can move forever, requiring \\nno beginning or end. Thus there is no necessity for a First or a Last \\nMover as long as mass and energy are conserved. \\n\\nFor the teleological proof, the theory of evolution shows that it is \\npossible to create higher and more complex life forms from more prim- \\nitive ones through natural selection and chance. Ultimately, we can trace \\nthe origin of life itself back to the spontaneous formation of protein \\nmolecules in the early earth\\'s oceans without appealing to a higher intel- \\nligence. Studies performed by Stanley L. Miller in 1955 have shown that \\nsparks sent through a flask containing methane, ammonia, and other \\ngases found in the early earth\\'s atmosphere can spontaneously create \\ncomplex hydrocarbon molecules and eventually amino acids (precursors \\n\\n\\n\\nBefore Creation \\n\\n\\n195 \\n\\n\\nto protein molecules) and other complex organic molecules. Thus a \\nFirst Designer is not necessary to create the essentials for life, which can \\napparently emerge naturally out of inorganic chemicals if they are given \\nenough time. \\n\\nAnd, finally. Immanuel Kant was the first to isolate the error in the \\nontological proof after centuries of confusion. Kant pointed out that \\nstating that an object exists does not make it more perfect. For example, \\nthis proof can be used to prove the existence of the unicorn. Ifwe define \\nthe unicorn to be the most perfect horse imaginable, and if unicorns \\ndon\\'t exist, then it\\'s possible to imagine a unicorn that does exist. But \\nsaying that it exists does not mean that it is more perfect than a unicorn \\nthat does not exist. Therefore, unicorns do not necessarily have to exist. \\nAnd neither does God. \\n\\nHave we made any progress since the time of St. Thomas Aquinas \\nand St. Anselm? \\n\\nYes and no. We can say that present-day theories of Creation are built \\non two pillars: quantum theory and Einstein\\'s theory of gravity. We can \\nsay that, for the first time in a thousand years, religious \"proofs\" of the \\nexistence of God are being replaced by our understanding of thermo- \\ndynamics and particle physics. However, by replacing God\\'s act of Cre- \\nation with the Big Bang, we have supplanted one problem with another. \\nAquinas thought he solved the problem of what came before God by \\ndefining him as the First Mover. Today, we are still struggling with the \\nquestion of what happened before the Big Bang. \\n\\nUnfortunately, Einstein\\'s equations break down at the enormously \\nsmall distances and large energies found at the origin of the universe. \\nAt distances on the order of 1 0 \\xe2\\x80\\x9d centimeter, quantum effects take over \\nfrom Einstein\\'s theory. Thus to resolve the philosophical questions \\ninvolving the beginning of time, we must necessarily invoke the ten- \\ndimensional theory. \\n\\nThroughout this book, we have emphasized the fact that the laws of \\nphysics unify when we add higher dimensions. When studying the Big \\nBang, we see the precise reverse of this statement. The Big Bang, as we \\nshall see, perhaps originated in the breakdown of the original ten- \\ndimensional universe into a four- and a six-dimensional universe. Thus \\nwe can view the history of the Big Bang as the history of the breakup of \\nten-dimensional space and hence the breakup of previously unified sym- \\nmetries. This, in turn, is the theme of this book in reverse. \\n\\nIt is no wonder, therefore, that piecing together the dynamics of the \\nBig Bang has been so difficult. In effect, by going backward in time, we \\nare reassembling the pieces of the ten-dimensional universe. \\n\\n\\n\\n196 \\n\\n\\nUNIFICATION IN TEN DIMENSIONS \\n\\n\\nExperimental Evidence for the Big Bang \\n\\nEvery year, we find more experimental evidence that the Big Bang \\noccurred roughly 15 to 20 billion years ago. Let us review some of these \\nexperimental results. \\n\\nFirst, the fact that the stars are receding from us at fantastic velocities \\nhas been repeatedly verified by measuring the distortion of their star- \\nlight (called the red shift). (The starlight of a receding star is shifted to \\nlonger wavelengths \\xe2\\x80\\x94 that is, toward the red end of the spectrum \\xe2\\x80\\x94 in the \\nsame way that the whistle of a receding train sounds higher than normal \\nwhen approaching and lower when receding. This is called the Doppler \\neffect. Also, Hubble\\'s Law states that the farther from us the star or \\ngalaxy, the faster it is receding from us. This fact, first announced by the \\nastronomer Edwin Hubble in 1929, has been experimentally verified \\nover the past 50 years.) We do not see any blue shift of the distant gal- \\naxies, which would mean a collapsing universe. \\n\\nSecond, we know that the distribution of the chemical elements in \\nour galaxy are in almost exact agreement with the prediction of heavy- \\nelement production in the Big Bang and in the stars. In the original Big \\nBang, because of the enormous heat, elemental hydrogen nuclei banged \\ninto one another at large enough velocities to fuse them, forming a new \\nelement: helium. The Big Bang theory predicts that the ratio of helium \\nto hydrogen in the universe should be approximately 25% helium to \\n75% hydrogen. This agrees with the observational result for the abun- \\ndance of helium in the universe. \\n\\nThird, the earliest objects in the universe date back 10 to 15 billion \\nyears, in agreement with the rough estimate for the Big Bang. We do \\nnot see any evidence for objects older than the Big Bang. Since radio- \\nactive materials decay (for example, via the weak interactions) at a pre- \\ncisely known rate, it is possible to tell the age of an object by calculating \\nthe relative abundance of certain radioactive materials. For example, \\nhalf of a radioactive substance called carbon-14 decays every 5,730 years, \\nwhich allows us to determine the age of archeological artifacts that con- \\ntain carbon. Other radioactive elements (like uranium-238, with a half- \\nlife of over 4 billion years) allow us to determine the age of moon rocks \\n(from the Apollo mission). The oldest rocks and meteors found on earth \\ndate to about 4 to 5 billion years, which is the approximate age of the \\nsolar system. By calculating the mass of certain stars whose evolution is \\nknown, we can show that the oldest stars in our galaxy date back about \\n10 billion years. \\n\\n\\n\\nBefore Creation \\n\\n\\n197 \\n\\n\\nFourth, and most important, the Big Bang produced a cosmic \\n\"echo\" reverberating throughout the universe that should be measur- \\nable by our instruments. In fact, Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson of the \\nBell Telephone Laboratories won the Nobel Prize in 1978 for detecting \\nthis echo of the Big Bang, a microwave radiation that permeates the \\nknown universe. The fact that the echo of the Big Bang should be cir- \\nculating around the universe billions of years after the event was first \\npredicted by George Gamow and his students Ralph Alpher and Robert \\nHerman, but no one took them seriously. The very idea of measuring \\nthe echo of Creation seemed outlandish when they first proposed this \\nidea soon after World War II. \\n\\nTheir logic, however, was very compelling. Any object, when heated, \\ngradually emits radiation. This is the reason why iron gets red hot when \\nplaced in a furnace. The hotter the iron, the higher the frequency of \\nradiation it emits. A precise mathematical formula, the Stefan-Boltz- \\nmann law, relates the frequency of light (or the color, in this case) to \\nthe temperature. (In fact, this is how scientists determine the surface \\ntemperature of a distant star, by examining its color.) This radiation is \\ncalled blackbody radiation. \\n\\nWhen the iron cools, the frequency of the emitted radiation also \\ndecreases, until the iron no longer emits in the visible range. The iron \\nreturns to its normal color, but it continues to emit invisible infrared \\nradiation. This is how the army\\'s night glasses operate in the dark. At \\nnight, relatively warm objects such as enemy soldiers and tank engines \\nmay be concealed in the darkness, but they continue to emit invisible \\nblackbody radiation in the form of infrared radiation, which can be \\npicked up by special infrared goggles. This is also why your sealed car \\ngets hot during the summer. Sunlight penetrates the glass of your car \\nand heats the interior. As it gets hot, it begins to emit blackbody radia- \\ntion in the form of infrared radiation. However, infrared radiation does \\nnot penetrate glass very well, and hence is trapped inside your car, dra- \\nmatically raising its temperature. (Similarly, blackbody radiation drives \\nthe greenhouse effect. Like glass, rising levels of carbon dioxide in the \\natmosphere, caused by the burning of fossil fuels, can trap the infrared \\nblackbody radiation of the earth and thereby gradually heat the \\nplanet.) \\n\\nGamow reasoned that the Big Bang was initially quite hot, and hence \\nwould be an ideal blackbody emitter of radiation. Although the tech- \\nnology of the 1940s was too primitive to pick up this faint signal from \\nCreation, he could calculate the temperature of this radiation and con- \\n\\n\\n\\n198 \\n\\n\\nUNIFICATION IN TEN DIMENSIONS \\n\\n\\nfidently predict that one day our instruments would be sensitive enough \\nto detect this \"fossil\" radiation. The logic behind his thinking was as \\nfollows: About 300,000 years after the Big Bang, the universe cooled to \\nthe point where atoms could begin to condense; electrons could begin \\nto circle protons and form stable atoms that would no longer be broken \\nup by the intense radiation permeating the universe. Before this time, \\nthe universe was so hot that atoms were continually ripped apart by \\nradiation as soon as they were formed. This meant that the universe was \\nopaque, like a thick, absorbing, and impenetrable fog. After 300,000 \\nyears, however, the radiation was no longer sufficiently strong to break \\nup the atoms, and hence light could travel long distances without being \\nscattered. In other words, the universe suddenly became black and trans- \\nparent after 300,000 years. (We are so used to hearing about the \"black- \\nness of outer space\" that we forget that the early universe was not trans- \\nparent at all, but filled with turbulent, opaque radiation.) \\n\\nAfter 300,000 years, electromagnetic radiation no longer interacted \\nso strongly with matter, and hence became blackbody radiation. Grad- \\nually, as the universe cooled, the frequency of this radiation decreased. \\nGarnow and his students calculated that the radiation would be far below \\nthe infrared range, into the microwave region. Gamow reasoned that by \\nscanning the heavens for a uniform, isotropic source of microwave radi- \\nation, one should be able to detect this microwave radiation and discover \\nthe echo of the Big Bang. \\n\\nGamow\\'s prediction was forgotten for many decades, until the micro- \\nwave background radiation was discovered quite by accident in 1965. \\nPenzias and Wilson found a mysterious background radiation permeat- \\ning all space when they turned on their new horn reflector antenna in \\nHolmdel, New Jersey. At first, they thought this unwanted radiation was \\ndue to electrical static caused by contaminants, such as bird droppings \\non their antenna. But when they disassembled and cleaned large por- \\ntions of the antenna, they found that the \"static\" persisted. At the same \\ntime, physicists Robert Dicke and James Peebles at Princeton University \\nwere rethinking Gamow\\'s old calculation. When Penzias and Wilson \\nwere finally informed of the Princeton physicists\\' work, it was clear that \\nthere was a direct relationship between their results. When they realized \\nthat this background radiation might be the echo of the original Big \\nBang, they are said to have exclaimed, \"Either we\\'ve seen a pile of bird \\ns 1, or the creation of the universe!\" They discovered that this uni- \\nform background radiation was almost exactly what had been predicted \\nyears earlier by George Gamow and his collaborators if the Big Bang had \\nleft a residual blanket of radiation that had cooled down to 3\\xc2\\xb0K. \\n\\n\\n\\nBefore Creation \\n\\n\\n199 \\n\\n\\nCOBE and the Big Bang \\n\\nPerhaps the most spectacular scientific confirmation of the Big Bang \\ntheory came in 1992 with the results of the COBE (Cosmic Background \\nExplorer) satellite. On April 23, newspaper headlines across the country \\nheralded the findings of a team of scientists at the University of Califor- \\nnia at Berkeley, led by George Smoot, who announced the most dra- \\nmatic, convincing argument for the Big Bang theory. Journalists and \\ncolumnists, with no background in physics or theology, were suddenly \\nwaxing eloquent about the \"face of God\" in their dispatches. \\n\\nThe COBE satellite was able to improve vastly the earlier work of \\nPenzias, Wilson, Peebles, and Dicke by many orders of magnitude, suf- \\nficient to rule out all doubt that the fossil radiation emitted by the Big \\nBang had been conclusively found. Princeton cosmologist Jeremiah P. \\nOstriker declared, \"When fossils were found in the rocks, it made the \\norigin of species absolutely clear-cut. Well, COBE found its fossils.\" 2 \\nLaunched in late 1989, the COBE satellite was specifically designed to \\nanalyze the microscopic details in the structure of the microwave back- \\nground radiation first postulated by George Gamow and his colleagues. \\nThe mission of COBE also had a new task: to resolve an earlier puzzle \\narising from the background radiation. \\n\\nThe original work of Penzias and Wilson was crude; they could show \\nonly that the background radiation was smooth to 10%. When scientists \\nanalyzed the background radiation in more detail, they found that it was \\nexceptionally smooth, with no apparent ripples, kinks, or blotches. In \\nfact, it was too smooth. The background radiation was like a smooth, \\ninvisible fog filling up the universe, so uniform that scientists had diffi- \\nculty reconciling it with known astronomical data. \\n\\nIn the 1970s, astronomers turned their great telescopes to systemat- \\nically map enormous collections of galaxies across large portions of the \\nsky. To their surprise, they found that, 1 billion years after the Big Bang, \\nthe universe had already exhibited a pattern of condensing into galaxies \\nand even large clusters of galaxies and huge, empty spaces called voids. \\nThe clusters were enormous, containing billions of galaxies at a time, \\nand the voids stretched across millions of light-years. \\n\\nBut here lay a cosmic mystery: If the Big Bang was exceptionally \\nsmooth and uniform, then 1 billion years was not enough time to \\ndevelop the dumpiness that we see among the galactic clusters. The \\ngross mismatch between the original smooth Big Bang and the lumpi- \\nness of the universe 1 billion years later was a nagging problem that \\ngnawed at every cosmologist. The Big Bang theory itself was never in any \\n\\n\\n\\n200 \\n\\n\\nUNIFICATION IN TEN DIMENSIONS \\n\\n\\ndoubt; what was in trouble was our understanding of the post-Big Bang \\nevolution 1 billion years after Creation. But without sensitive satellites \\nthat could measure the cosmic background radiation, the problem fes- \\ntered over the years. In fact, by 1990. journalists without a rigorous sci- \\nence background began to write sensational articles saying erroneously \\nthat scientists had found a fatal flaw in the Big Bang theory itself. Many \\njournalists wrote that the Big Bang theory was about to be overthrown. \\nLong-discredited alternatives to the Big Bang theory began to resurface \\nin the press. Even the New York Times published a major article saying \\nthat the Big Bang theory was in serious trouble (which was scientifically \\nincorrect). \\n\\nThis pseudocontroversy surrounding the Big Bang theory made the \\nannouncement of the COBE data all the more interesting. With unprec- \\nedented accuracy, capable of detecting variations as small as one part in \\n100,000, the COBE satellite was able to scan the heavens and radio back \\nthe most accurate map of the cosmic background radiation ever con- \\nstructed. The COBE results reconfirmed the Big Bang theory, and more. \\n\\nCOBEs data, however, were not easy to analyze. The team led by \\nSmoot had to face enormous problems. For example, they had to sub- \\ntract carefully the effect of the earth\\'s motion in the background radi- \\nation. The solar system drifts at a velocity of 370 kilometers per second \\nrelative to the background radiation. There is also the relative motion \\nof the solar system with respect to the galaxy, and the galaxy\\'s complex \\nmotions with respect to galactic clusters. Nevertheless, after painstaking \\ncomputer enhancement, several stunning results came out of the anal- \\nysis. First, the microwave background fit the earlier prediction of George \\nGarnow (adjusted with more accurate experimental numbers) to within \\n0.1% (Figure 9.1). The solid line represents the prediction; the x\\'s mark \\nthe data points measured by the COBE satellite. When this graph was \\nflashed on the screen for the first time to a meeting of about a thousand \\nastronomers, everyone in the room erupted in a standing ovation. This \\nwas perhaps the first time in the history of science that a simple graph \\nreceived such a thunderous applause from so many distinguished sci- \\nentists. \\n\\nSecond, Smoot\\'s team was able to show that tiny, almost microscopic \\nblotches did, in fact, appear in the microwave background. These tiny \\nblotches were precisely what was needed to explain the dumpiness and \\nvoids found 1 billion years after the Big Bang. (If these blotches had not \\nbeen found by COBE, then a major revision in the post-Big Bang analysis \\nwould have had to be made.) \\n\\nThird, the results were consistent with, but did not prove, the so- \\n\\n\\n\\nBefore Creation \\n\\n\\n201 \\n\\n\\n\\nbickgroiid r ad i a t i \\xc2\\xab i \\n\\nFigure 9.1. The solid line represents the prediction made by the Big Bang theory, \\nwhich predicts that the background cosmic radiation should resemble blackbody \\nradiation in the microwave region. The x\\'s represent the actual data collected by \\nthe COBE satellite, giving us one of the most convincing proofs of the Big Bang \\ntheory. \\n\\n\\ncalled inflation theory. (This theory, proposed by Alan Guth of MIT, states \\nthat there was a much more explosive expansion of the universe at the \\ninitial instant of Creation than the usual Big Bang scenario; it holds that \\nthe visible universe we see with our telescopes is only the tiniest part of \\na much bigger universe whose boundaries lie beyond our visible hori- \\nzon.) \\n\\n\\nBefore Creation: Orbifolds? \\n\\nThe COBE results have given physicists confidence that we understand \\nthe origin of the universe to within a fraction of a second after the Big \\nBang. However, we are still left with the embarrassing questions of what \\npreceded the Big Bang and why it occurred. General relativity, if taken \\nto its limits, ultimately yields nonsensical answers. Einstein, realizing that \\ngeneral relatively simply breaks down at those enormously small dis- \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n202 \\n\\n\\nUNIFICATION IN TEN DIMENSIONS \\n\\n\\ntances, tried to extend general relativity into a more comprehensive the- \\nory that could explain these phenomena. \\n\\nAt the instant of the Big Bang, we expect quantum effects to be the \\ndominant force, overwhelming gravity. The key to the origin of the Big \\nBang, therefore, is a quantum theory of gravity. So far, the only theory \\nthat can claim to solve the mystery of what happened before the Big \\nBang is the ten-dimensional superstring theory. Scientists are just now \\nconjecturing how the ten-dimensional universe split into a four- and a \\nsix-dimensional universe. What does our twin universe look like? \\n\\nOne physicist who is struggling with these cosmic questions is Cum- \\nrum Vafa, a Harvard professor who has spent several years studying how \\nour ten-dimensional universe may have been torn into two smaller uni- \\nverses. He is, ironically, also a physicist torn between two worlds. Living \\nin Cambridge, Massachusetts, Vafa is originally from Iran, which has \\nbeen racked by political convulsions for the past decade. On the one \\nhand, he wishes eventually to return to his native Iran, perhaps when \\nthe social tumult has calmed down. On the other hand, his research \\ntakes him far from that troubled region of the world, all the way to the \\nfar reaches of six-dimensional space, long before the tumult in the early \\nuniverse had a chance to stabilize. \\n\\n\"Imagine a simple video game,\" he says. A rocket ship can travel in \\nthe video screen, he points out, until it veers too far to the right. Any \\nvideo-game player knows that the rocket ship then suddenly appears \\nfrom the left side of the screen, at exactly the same height. Similarly, if \\nthe rocket ship wanders too far and falls off the bottom of the screen, it \\nrematerializes at the top of the screen. Thus, Vafa explains, there is an \\nentirely self-contained universe in that video screen. You can never leave \\nthe universe defined by that screen. Even so, most teenagers have never \\nasked themselves what that universe is actually shaped like. Vafa points \\nout, surprisingly enough, that the topology of the video screen is that of \\nan inner tube! \\n\\nThink of the video screen as a sheet of paper. Since points at the top \\nof the screen are identical to the points at the bottom, we can seal the \\ntop and bottom sides together with glue. We now have rolled the sheet \\nof paper into a tube. But the points on the left side of the tube are \\nidentical to the points on the right side of the tube. One way to glue \\nthese two ends is to bend the tube carefully into a circle, and seal the \\ntwo open ends together with glue (Figure 9.2). \\n\\nWhat we have done is to turn a sheet of paper into a doughnut. A \\nrocket ship wandering on the video screen can be described as moving \\non the surface of an inner tube. Every time the rocket vanishes off the \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 9.2. If a rocket disappears off the right side of a video-game screen, it re- \\nemerges on the left. If it disappears at the top, it re-emerges at the bottom. Let us \\nnow wrap the screen so that identical points match. We first match the top and \\nbottom points by wrapping up the screen. Then we match the points on the left- \\nand right-hand sides by rolling up the screen like a tube. In this way, we can \\nshow that a video-game screen has the topology of a doughnut. \\n\\n\\n203 \\n\\n\\n\\n204 \\n\\n\\nUNIFICATION IN TEN DIMENSIONS \\n\\n\\nvideo screen and reappears on the other side of the screen, this corre- \\nsponds to the rocket ship moving across the glued joint of the inner \\ntube. \\n\\nVafa conjectures that our sister universe has the shape of some sort \\nof twisted six-dimensional torus. Vafa and his colleagues have pioneered \\nthe concept that our sister universe can be described by what mathe- \\nmaticians call an orbifold. In fact, his proposal that our sister universe has \\nthe topology of an orbifold seems to fit the observed data rather well.\\' \\n\\nTo visualize an orbifold, think of moving 360 degrees in a circle. \\nEveryone knows that we come back to the same point. In other words, \\nif I dance 360 degrees around a May pole. I know that I will come back \\nto the same spot. In an orbifold, however, if we move less than 360 \\ndegrees around the May pole, we will still come back to the same point. \\nAlthough this may sound preposterous, it is easy to construct orbifolds. \\nThink of Flatlanders living on a cone. If they move less than 360 degrees \\naround the apex of the cone, they arrive at the same spot. Thus an \\norbifold is a higher-dimensional generalization of a cone (Figure 9.3). \\n\\nTo get a feel for orbifolds, imagine that some Flatlanders live on what \\nis called a Z-orbifold, which is equivalent to the surface of a square bean \\nbag (like those found at carnivals and country fairs). At first, nothing \\nseems different from living in Flatland itself. As they explore the surface, \\nhowever, they begin to find strange happenings. For example, if a Flat- \\nlander walks in any direction long enough, he returns to his original \\nposition as though he walked in a circle. However. Flatlanders also notice \\nthat there is something strange about certain points in their universe \\n(the four points of the bean bag). When walking around any of these \\nfour points by 180 degrees (not 360 degrees), they return to the same \\nplace from which they started. \\n\\nThe remarkable thing about Vafa\\'s orbifolds is that, with just a few \\nassumptions, we can derive many of the features of quarks and other \\nsubatomic particles. (This is because, as we saw earlier, the geometry of \\nspace in Kaluza-Klein theory forces the quarks to assume the symmetry \\nof that space.) This gives us confidence that we are on the right track. \\nIf these orbifolds gave us totally meaningless results, then our intuition \\nwould tell us that there is something fundamentally wrong with this con- \\nstruction. \\n\\nIf none of the solutions of string theory contains the Standard Model, \\nthen we must throw away superstring theory as another promising but \\nultimately incorrect theory. However, physicists are excited by the fact \\nthat it is possible to obtain solutions that are tantalizingly close to the \\nStandard Model. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n206 \\n\\n\\nUNIFICATION IN TEN DIMENSIONS \\n\\n\\nMathematicians for the past 80 years have been working out the prop- \\nerties of these weird surfaces in higher dimensions, ever since the French \\nmathematician Henri Poincare pioneered the subject of topology in the \\nearly twentieth century. Thus the ten-dimensional theory is able to incor- \\nporate a large body of modern mathematics that previously seemed quite \\nuseless. \\n\\n\\nWhy Are There Three Generations? \\n\\nIn particular, the rich storehouse of mathematical theorems compiled \\nby mathematicians over the past century are now being used to explain \\nwhy there are three families of particles. As we saw earlier, one disastrous \\nfeature of the GUTs is that there are three identical families of quarks \\nand leptons. However, orbifolds may explain this disconcerting feature \\nof the GUTs. 4 \\n\\nVafa and his co-workers have discovered many promising solutions \\nto the string equations that appear to resemble the physical world. With \\na remarkably small set of assumptions, in fact, they can rederive the \\nStandard Model, which is an important step for the theory. This is, in \\nfact, both the strength and the weakness of superstring theory. Vafa and \\nhis co-workers have been, in a way, too successful: They have found mil- \\nlions of other possible solutions to the string equations. \\n\\nThe fundamental problem facing superstring theory is this: Of the \\nmillions of possible universes that can be mathematically generated by superstring \\ntheory, which is the correct one? As David Gross has said, \\n\\n[T]here are millions and millions of solutions that have three spatial \\ndimensions. There is an enormous abundance of possible classical solu- \\ntions. . . . This abundance of riches was originally very pleasing because it \\nprovided evidence that a theory like the heterotic string could look very \\nmuch like the real world. These solutions, in addition to having four space- \\ntime dimensions, had many other properties that resemble our world \\xe2\\x80\\x94 \\nthe right kinds ofparticles such as quarks and leptons, and the right kinds \\nof interactions. . . . That was a source of excitement two years ago . 5 \\n\\n\\nGross cautions that although some of these solutions are very close \\nto the Standard Model, other solutions produce undesirable physical \\nproperties: \"It is, however, slightly embarrassing that we have so many \\nsolutions but no good way of choosing among them. It seems even more \\nembarrassing that these solutions have, in addition to many desired \\nproperties, a few potentially disastrous properties.\"\\' A layperson, hear- \\n\\n\\n\\nBefore Creation \\n\\n\\n207 \\n\\n\\ning this for the first time, may be puzzled and ask: Why don\\'t youjust \\ncalculate which solution the string prefers? Since string theory is a well- \\ndefined theory, it seems puzzling that physicists cannot calculate the \\nanswer. \\n\\nThe problem is that the perturbation theory, one of the main tools \\nin physics, is of no use. Perturbation theory (which adds up increasingly \\nsmall quantum corrections) fails to break the ten-dimensional theory \\ndown to four and six dimensions. Thus we are forced to use nonpertur- \\nbative methods, which are notoriously difficult to use. This, then, is the \\nreason why we cannot solve string theory. As we said earlier, string field \\ntheory, developed by Kikkawa and me and further improved by Witten, \\ncannot at present be solved nonperturbatively . No one is smart enough. \\n\\nI once had a roommate who was a graduate student in history. I \\nremember one day he warned me about the computer revolution, which \\neventually might put physicists out of ajob. \"After all,\" he said, \"com- \\nputers can calculate everything, can\\'t they?\" To him, it was only a matter \\nof time before mathematicians put all physics questions in the computer \\nand physicists got on the unemployment line. \\n\\nI was taken aback by the comment, because to a physicist a computer \\nis nothing more than a sophisticated adding machine, an impeccable \\nidiot. It makes up in speed what it lacks in intelligence. You have to \\ninput the theory into the computer before it can make a calculation. \\nThe computer cannot generate new theories by itself. \\n\\nFurthermore, even if a theory is known, the computer may take an \\ninfinite amount of time to solve a problem. In fact, computing all the \\nreally interesting questions in physics would take an infinite amount of \\ncomputer time. This is the problem with string theory. Although Vafa \\nand his colleagues have produced millions ofpossible solutions, it would \\ntake an infinite amount of time to decide which of the millions of pos- \\nsibilities was the correct one, or to calculate solutions to quantum prob- \\nlems involving the bizarre process of tunneling, one of the most difficult \\nof quantum phenomena to solve. \\n\\n\\nTunneling Through Space and Time \\n\\nIn the final analysis, we are asking the same question posed by Kaluza \\nin 1919 \\xe2\\x80\\x94 Where did the fifth dimension go? \\xe2\\x80\\x94 except on a much higher \\nlevel. As Klein pointed out in 1926, the answer to this question has to \\ndo with quantum theory. Perhaps the most startling (and complex) phe- \\nnomenon in quantum theory is tunneling. \\n\\n\\n\\n208 \\n\\n\\nUNIFICATION IN TEN DIMENSIONS \\n\\n\\nFor example. I am now sitting in a chair. The thought of my body \\nsuddenly zapping through the molecules of the wall next to me and \\nreassembling, uninvited, in someone else\\'s living room is an unpleasant \\none. Also an unlikely one. However, quantum mechanics postulates that \\nthere is a finite (although small) probability that even the most unlikely, \\nbizarre events \\xe2\\x80\\x94 such as waking up one morning and finding our bed in \\nthe middle of the Amazonjungle \\xe2\\x80\\x94 will actually happen. All events, no \\nmatter how strange, are reduced by quantum theory to probabilities. \\n\\nThis tunneling process sounds more like science fiction than real \\nscience. However, tunneling can be measured in the laboratory and, in \\nfact, solves the riddle of radioactive decay. Normally, the nucleus of an \\natom is stable. The protons and neutrons within the nucleus are bound \\ntogether by the nuclear force. However, there is a small probability that \\nthe nucleus might fall apart, that the protons and neutrons might escape \\nby tunneling past the large energy barrier, the nuclear force, that binds \\nthe nucleus together. Ordinarily, we would say that all nuclei must there- \\nfore be stable. But it is an undeniable fact that uranium nuclei do, in \\nfact, decay when they shouldn\\'t; in fact, the conservation of energy law \\nis briefly violated as the neutrons in the nucleus tunnel their way through \\nthe barrier. \\n\\nThe catch, however, is that these probabilities are vanishingly small \\nfor large objects, such as humans. The probability of our tunneling \\nthrough a wall within the lifetime of the known universe is infinitesimally \\nsmall. Thus I can safely assume that I will not be ungraciously trans- \\nported through the wall, at least within my own lifetime. Similarly, our \\nuniverse, which originally might have begun as a ten-dimensional uni- \\nverse, was not stable; it tunneled and exploded into a four- and a six- \\ndimensional universe. \\n\\nTo understand this form of tunneling, think of an imaginary Charlie \\nChaplin film, in which Chaplin is trying to stretch a bed sheet around \\nan oversize bed. The sheet is the kind with elastic bands on the corners. \\nBut it is too small, so he has to strain to wrap the elastic bands around \\neach corner of the mattress, one at a time. He grins with satisfaction \\nonce he has stretched the bed sheet smoothly around all four corners \\nof the bed. But the strain is too great; one elastic band pops off one \\ncorner, and the bed sheet curls up. Frustrated, he pulls this elastic \\naround the corner, only to have another elastic pop off another corner. \\nEvery time he yanks an elastic band around one corner, another elastic \\npops off another corner. \\n\\nThis process is called symmetry breaking. The smoothly stretched bed \\nsheet possesses a high degree of symmetry. You can rotate the bed 180 \\n\\n\\n\\nBefore Creation \\n\\n\\n209 \\n\\n\\ndegrees along any axis, and the bed sheet remains the same. This highly \\nsymmetrical state is called the false vacuum. Although the false vacuum \\nappears quite symmetrical, it is not stable. The sheet does not want to \\nbe in this stretched condition. There is too much tension. The energy \\nis too high. Thus one elastic pops off, and the bed sheet curls up. The \\nsymmetry is broken, and the bed sheet has gone to a lower-energy state \\nwith less symmetry. By rotating the curled-up bed sheet 180 degrees \\naround an axis, we no longer return to the same sheet. \\n\\nNow replace the bed sheet with ten-dimensional space-time, the \\nspace-time of ultimate symmetry. At the beginning of time, the universe \\nwas perfectly symmetrical. If anyone was around at that time, he could \\nfreely pass through any of the ten dimensions without problem. At that \\ntime, gravity and the weak, the strong, and the electromagnetic forces \\nwere all unified by the superstring. All matter and forces were part of \\nthe same string multiplet. However, this symmetry couldn\\'t last. The ten- \\ndimensional universe, although perfectly symmetrical, was unstable, just \\nlike the bed sheet, and in a false vacuum. Thus tunneling to a lower- \\nenergy state was inevitable. When tunneling finally occurred, a phase \\ntransition took place, and symmetry was lost. \\n\\nBecause the universe began to split up into a four- and a six-dimen- \\nsional universe, the universe was no longer symmetrical. Six dimensions \\nhave curled up, in the same way that the bed sheet curls up when one \\nelastic pops off a corner of a mattress. But notice that there are four \\nways in which the bed sheet can curl up, depending on which corner \\npops off first. For the ten-dimensional universe, however, there are \\napparently millions of ways in which to curl up. To calculate which state \\nthe ten-dimensional universe prefers, we need to solve the field theory \\nof strings using the theory of phase transitions, the most difficult prob- \\nlem in quantum theory. \\n\\n\\nSymmetry Breaking \\n\\nPhase transitions are nothing new. Think of our own lives. In her book \\nPassages, Gail Sheehy stresses that life is not a continuous stream of expe- \\nriences, as it often appears, but actually passes through several stages, \\ncharacterized by specific conflicts that must be resolved and goals that \\nmust be achieved. \\n\\nThe psychologist Erik Erikson even proposed a theory of the psycho- \\nlogical stages of development. A fundamental conflict characterizes each \\nphase. When this conflict is correctly resolved, we move on to the next \\n\\n\\n\\n210 \\n\\n\\nUNIFICATION IN TEN DIMENSIONS \\n\\n\\nphase. If this conflict is not resolved, it may fester and even cause regres- \\nsion to an earlier period. Similarly, the psychologist Jean Piaget showed \\nthat early childhood mental development is also not a smooth process \\nof learning, but is actually typified by abrupt stages in a child\\'s ability to \\nconceptualize. One month, a child may give up looking for a ball once \\nit has rolled out of view, not understanding that an object exists even if \\nyou can no longer see it. The next month, this is obvious to the child. \\n\\nThis is the essence of dialectics. According to this philosophy, all \\nobjects (people, gases, the universe itself) go through a series of stages. \\nEach stage is characterized by a conflict between two opposing forces. \\nThe nature of this conflict, in fact, determines the nature of the stage. \\nWhen the conflict is resolved, the object goes to a higher stage, called \\nthe synthesis, where a new contradiction begins, and the process starts \\nover again at a higher level. \\n\\nPhilosophers call this the transition from \"quantity\" to \"quality.\" \\nSmall quantitative changes eventually build up until there is a qualitative \\nrupture with the past. This theory applies to societies as well. Tensions \\nin a society can rise dramatically, as they did in France in the late eigh- \\nteenth century. The peasants faced starvation, spontaneous food riots \\ntook place, and the aristocracy retreated behind its fortresses. When the \\ntensions reached the breaking point, a phase transition occurred from \\nthe quantitative to the qualitative: The peasants took up arms, seized \\nParis, and stormed the Bastille. \\n\\nPhase transitions can also be quite explosive affairs. For example, \\nthink of a river that has been dammed up. A reservoir quickly fills up \\nbehind the dam with water under enormous pressure. Because it is \\nunstable, the reservoir is in the false vacuum. The water would prefer to \\nbe in its true vacuum, meaning it would prefer to burst the dam and \\nwash downstream, to a state of lower energy. Thus a phase transition \\nwould involve a dam burst, which could have disastrous consequences. \\n\\nAn even more explosive example is an atomic bomb. The false vac- \\nuum corresponds to stable uranium nuclei. Although the uranium \\nnucleus appears stable, there are enormous, explosive energies trapped \\nwithin the uranium nucleus that are a million times more powerful, \\npound for pound, than a chemical explosive. Once in a while, the \\nnucleus tunnels to a lower state, which means that the nucleus sponta- \\nneously splits apart all by itself. This is called radioactive decay. However, \\nit is possible, by shooting neutrons at the uranium nucleus, to release \\nthis pent-up energy all at once. This, of course, is an atomic explosion. \\n\\nThe new feature discovered by scientists about phase transitions is \\nthat they are usually accompanied by a symmetry breaking. Nobel lau- \\n\\n\\n\\nBefore Creation \\n\\n\\n211 \\n\\n\\nreate Abdus Salam likes the following illustration: Consider a circular \\nbanquet table, where all the guests are seated with a champagne glass \\non either side. There is a symmetry here. Looking at the banquet table \\nthrough a mirror, we see the same thing: each guest seated around the \\ntable, with champagne glasses on either side. Similarly, we can rotate \\nthe circular banquet table, and the arrangement is still the same. \\n\\nNow break the symmetry. Assume that the first diner picks up the \\nglass on his or her right. By custom, all the other guests pick up the \\nchampagne glass to their right. Notice that the image of the banquet \\ntable as seen in the mirror produces the opposite situation. Every diner \\nhas picked up the glass to his or her left. Thus left-right symmetry has \\nbeen broken. \\n\\nAnother example of symmetry breaking comes from an ancient fairy \\ntale. This fable concerns a princess who is trapped on top of a polished \\ncrystal sphere. Although there are no iron bars confining her to the \\nsphere, she is a prisoner because if she makes the slightest move, she \\nwill slip off the sphere and kill herself. Numerous princes have tried to \\nrescue the princess, but each has failed to scale the sphere because it is \\ntoo smooth and slippery. This is an example of symmetry breaking. \\nWhile the princess is atop the sphere, she is in a perfectly symmetrical \\nstate. There is no preferred direction for the sphere. We can rotate the \\nsphere at any angle, and the situation remains the same. Any false move \\noff the center, however, will cause the princess to fall, thereby breaking \\nthe symmetry. If she falls to the west, for example, the symmetry of rota- \\ntion is broken. The westerly direction is now singled out. \\n\\nThus the state of maximum symmetry is often also an unstable state, \\nand hence corresponds to a false vacuum. The true vacuum state cor- \\nresponds to the princess falling off the sphere. So a phase transition \\n(falling off the sphere) corresponds to symmetry breaking (selecting the \\nwesterly direction). \\n\\nRegarding superstring theory, physicists assume (but cannot yet \\nprove) that the original ten-dimensional universe was unstable and tun- \\nneled its way to a four- and a six-dimensional universe. Thus the original \\nuniverse was in the state of the false vacuum, the state of maximum \\nsymmetry, while today we are in the broken state of the true vacuum. \\n\\nThis raises a disturbing question: What would happen if our universe \\nwere actually not the true vacuum? What would happen if the superstr- \\ning only temporarily chose our universe, but the true vacuum lay among \\nthe millions of possible orbifolds? This would have disastrous conse- \\nquences. In many other orbifolds, we find that the Standard Model is \\nnot present. Thus if the true vacuum were actually a state where the \\n\\n\\n\\n212 \\n\\n\\nUNIFICATION IN TEN DIMENSIONS \\n\\n\\nStandard Model was not present, then all the laws of chemistry and phys- \\nics, as we know them, would come tumbling down. \\n\\nIf this occurred, a tiny bubble might suddenly appear in our universe. \\nWithin this bubble, the Standard Model would no longer hold, so a \\ndifferent set of chemical and physical laws would apply. Matter inside \\nthe bubble would disintegrate and perhaps re-form in different ways. \\nThis bubble would then expand at the speed of light, swallowing up \\nentire star systems, galaxies, and galactic clusters, until it gobbled up the \\nentire universe. \\n\\nWe would never see it coming. Traveling at the speed oflight, it could \\nnever be observed beforehand. We would never know what hit us. \\n\\n\\nFrom Ice Cubes to Superstrings \\n\\nConsider an ordinary ice cube sitting in a pressure cooker in our kitchen. \\nWe all know what happens if we turn on the stove. But what happens to \\nan ice cube if we heat it up to trillions upon trillions of degrees? \\n\\nIfwe heat the ice cube on the stove, first it melts and turns into water; \\nthat is, it undergoes a phase transition. Now let us heat the water until \\nit boils. It then undergoes another phase transition and turns into steam. \\nNow continue to heat the steam to enormous temperatures. Eventually, \\nthe water molecules break up. The energy of the molecules exceeds the \\nbinding energy of the molecules, which are ripped apart into elemental \\nhydrogen and oxygen gas. \\n\\nNow we continue to heat it past 3,000\\xc2\\xb0K, until the atoms of hydrogen \\nand oxygen are ripped apart. The electrons are pulled from the nucleus, \\nand we now have a plasma (an ionized gas), often called the fourth state \\nof matter (after gases, liquids, and solids). Although a plasma is not part \\nof common experience, we can see it every time we look at the sun. In \\nfact, plasma is the most common state of matter in the universe. \\n\\nNow continue to heat the plasma on the stove to 1 billion\\xc2\\xb0K, until \\nthe nuclei of hydrogen and oxygen are ripped apart, and we have a \\n\"gas\" of individual neutrons and protons, similar to the interior of a \\nneutron star. \\n\\nIfwe heat the \"gas\" of nucleons even further to 10 trillion\\xc2\\xb0K. these \\nsubatomic particles will turn into disassociated quarks. We will now have \\na gas of quarks and leptons (the electrons and neutrinos). \\n\\nIfwe heat this gas to 1 quadrillion 0 !!, the electromagnetic force and \\nthe weak force will become united. The symmetry SU(2) X U ( 1 ) will \\nemerge at this temperature. At 1 0 = \\xe2\\x80\\x9c \\xc2\\xb0K, the electroweak and strong forces \\n\\n\\n\\nBefore Creation \\n\\n\\n213 \\n\\n\\nbecome united, and the GUT symmetries [SU(5), 0(10), or E(6)] \\nappear. \\n\\nFinally, at a fabulous 10\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xc2\\xb0K, gravity unites with the GUT force, and \\nall the symmetries of the ten-dimensional superstring appear. We now \\nhave a gas of superstrings. At that point, so much energy will have gone \\ninto the pressure cooker that the geometry of space-time may very well \\nbegin to distort, and the dimensionality of space-time may change. The \\nspace around our kitchen may very well become unstable, a rip may form \\nin the fabric of space, and a wormhole may appear in the kitchen. At \\nthis point, it may be advisable to leave the kitchen. \\n\\n\\nCooling the Big Bang \\n\\nThus by heating an ordinary ice cube to fantastic temperatures, we can \\nretrieve the superstring. The lesson here is that matter goes through \\ndefinite stages of development as we heat it up. Eventually, more and \\nmore symmetry becomes restored as we increase the energy. \\n\\nBy reversing this process, we can appreciate how the Big Bang \\noccurred as a sequence of different stages. Instead of heating an ice \\ncube, we now cool the superhot matter in the universe through different \\nstages. Beginning with the instant of Creation, we have the following \\nstages in the evolution of our universe. \\n\\n10 41 seconds The ten-dimensional universe breaks down to a four- \\nand a six-dimensional universe. The six-dimensional universe collapses \\ndown to 1 0 \\xe2\\x80\\x9d centimeter in size. The four-dimensional universe inflates \\nrapidly. The temperature is 10\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xc2\\xb0K. \\n\\n10 \\xe2\\x80\\x9d seconds The GUT force breaks; the strong force is no longer \\nunited with the electroweak interactions. SU(3) breaks offfrom the GUT \\nsymmetry. A small speck in the larger universe becomes inflated by a \\nfactor of 1 0 5 0 , eventually becoming our visible universe. \\n\\n10\" seconds The temperature is now 10\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xc2\\xb0K, and the electroweak \\nsymmetry breaks into SU(2) and U(l). \\n\\n10 \\' seconds Quarks begin to condense into neutrons and protons. \\nThe temperature is roughly 10\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xc2\\xb0K. \\n\\n3 minutes The protons and neutrons are now condensing into stable \\nnuclei. The energy of random collisions is no longer powerful enough \\nto break up the nucleus of the emerging nuclei. Space is still opaque to \\nlight because ions do not transmit light well. \\n\\n300,000 years Electrons begin to condense around nuclei. Atoms \\n\\n\\n\\n214 \\n\\n\\nUNIFICATION IN TEN DIMENSIONS \\n\\n\\nbegin to form. Because light is no longer scattered or absorbed as much, \\nthe universe becomes transparent to light. Outer space becomes black. \\n\\n3 billion years The first quasars appear. \\n\\n5 billion years The first galaxies appear. \\n\\n10 to 15 billion years The solar system is born. A few billion years \\nafter that, the first forms of life appear on earth. \\n\\nIt seems almost incomprehensible that we, as intelligent apes on the \\nthird planet of a minor star in a minor galaxy, would be able to recon- \\nstruct the history of our universe going back almost to the instant of its \\nbirth, where temperatures and pressures exceeded anything ever found \\nin our solar system. Yet the quantum theory of the weak, electromag- \\nnetic, and strong interactions reveals this picture to us. \\n\\nAs startling as this picture of Creation is, perhaps stranger still is the \\npossibility that wormholes can act as gateways to another universe and \\nperhaps even as time machines into the past and future. Armed with a \\nquantum theory of gravity, physicists may be able to answer the intrigu- \\ning questions: Are there parallel universes? Can the past be changed? \\n\\n\\n\\nPART III \\n\\n\\nWormholes: \\nGateways to \\nAnother Universe? \\n\\n\\n\\n10 \\n\\nBlack Holes and \\nParallel Universes \\n\\n\\nListen, there\\'s a hell of a universe next door: let\\'s go! \\n\\ne. e. cummings \\n\\n\\nBlack Holes: Tunnels Through Space and Time \\n\\n\\nB LACK holes have recently seized the public\\'s imagination. Books \\nand documentaries have been devoted to exploring this strange \\nprediction of Einstein\\'s equations, the final stage in the death of a col- \\nlapsed star. Ironically, the public remains largely unaware of perhaps the \\nmost peculiar feature of black holes, that they may be gateways to an \\nalternative universe. Furthermore, there is also intense speculation in the \\nscientific community that a black hole may open up a tunnel in time. \\n\\nTo understand black holes and how difficult they are to find, we must \\nfirst understand what makes the stars shine, how they grow, and how \\nthey eventually die. A star is born when a massive cloud of hydrogen gas \\nmany times the size of our solar system is slowly compressed by the force \\nof gravity. The gravitational force compressing the gas gradually heats \\nup the gas, as gravitational energy is converted into the kinetic energy \\nof the hydrogen atoms. Normally, the repulsive charge of the protons \\nwithin the hydrogen gas is sufficient to keep them apart. But at a certain \\npoint, when the temperature rises to 10 to 100 million\\xc2\\xb0K, the kinetic \\n\\n\\n217 \\n\\n\\n\\n218 WORMHOLES: GATEWAYS TO ANOTHER UNIVERSE? \\n\\nenergy of the protons (which are hydrogen nuclei) overcomes their elec- \\ntrostatic repulsion, and they slam into one another. The nuclear force \\nthen takes over from the electromagnetic force, and the two hydrogen \\nnuclei \"fuse\" into helium, releasing vast quantities of energy. \\n\\nIn other words, a star is a nuclear furnace, burning hydrogen fuel \\nand creating nuclear \"ash\" in the form of waste helium. A star is also a \\ndelicate balancing act between the force of gravity, which tends to crush \\nthe star into oblivion, and the nuclear force, which tends to blow the \\nstar apart with the force of trillions of hydrogen bombs. A star then \\nmatures and ages as it exhausts its nuclear fuel. \\n\\nTo see how energy is extracted from the fusion process and to under- \\nstand the stages in the life of a star leading to a black hole, we must \\nanalyze Figure 10.1, which shows one of the most important curves in \\nmodern science, sometimes called the binding energy curve. On the hor- \\nizontal scale is the atomic weight of the various elements, from hydrogen \\nto uranium. On the vertical scale, crudely speaking, is the approximate \\naverage \"weight\" of each proton in the nucleus. Notice that hydrogen \\nand uranium have protons that weigh, on average, more than the pro- \\ntons of other elements in the center of the diagram. \\n\\nOur sun is an ordinary yellow star, consisting mainly of hydrogen. \\nLike the original Big Bang, it fuses hydrogen and forms helium. How- \\never, because the protons in hydrogen weigh more than the protons in \\nhelium, there is an excess of mass, which is converted into energy via \\nEinstein\\'s E = me 1 formula. This energy is what binds the nuclei together. \\nThis is also the energy released when hydrogen is fused into helium. \\nThis is why the sun shines. \\n\\nHowever, as the hydrogen is slowly used up over several billion years, \\na yellow star eventually builds up too much waste helium, and its nuclear \\nfurnace shuts off. When that happens, gravity eventually takes over and \\ncrushes the star. As temperatures soar, the star soon becomes hot \\nenough to burn waste helium and convert it into the other elements, \\nlike lithium and carbon. Notice that energy can still be released as we \\ndescend down the curve to the higher elements. In other words, it is still \\npossible to burn waste helium (in the same way that ordinary ash can \\nstill be burned under certain conditions). Although the star has \\ndecreased enormously in size, its temperature is quite high, and its atmo- \\nsphere expands greatly in size. In fact, when our own sun exhausts its \\nhydrogen supply and starts to burn helium, its atmosphere may extend \\nout to the orbit of Mars. This is what is called a red giant. This means, of \\ncourse, that the earth will be vaporized in the process. Thus the curve \\nalso predicts the ultimate fate of the earth. Since our sun is a middle- \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 10.1. The average \"weight\" of each proton of lighter elements, such as \\nhydrogen and helium, is relatively large. Thus if we fuse hydrogen to form helium \\ninside a star, we have excess mass, which is converted to energy via Einstein\\'s \\nequation E = mc ! . This is the energy that lights up the stars. But as stars fuse \\nheavier and heavier elements, eventually we reach iron, and we cannot extract \\nany more energy. The star then collapses, and the tremendous heat of collapse \\ncreates a supernova. This colossal explosion rips the star apart and seeds the \\ninterstellar space, in which new stars are formed. The process then starts all over \\nagain, like a pinball machine. \\n\\n\\n219 \\n\\n\\n220 \\n\\n\\nWORMHOLES: GATEWAYS TO ANOTHER UNIVERSE? \\n\\n\\naged star about 5 billion years old, it still has another 5 billion years \\nbefore it consumes the earth. (Ironically, the earth was originally born \\nout of the same swirling gas cloud that created our sun. Physics now \\npredicts that the earth, which was created with the sun, will return to \\nthe sun.) \\n\\nFinally, when the helium is used up, the nuclear furnace again shuts \\ndown, and gravity takes over to crush the star. The red giant shrinks to \\nbecome a white dwarf, a miniature star with the mass of an entire star \\nsqueezed down to about the size of the planet earth. 1 White dwarfs are \\nnot very luminous because, after descending to the bottom of the curve, \\nthere is only a little excess energy one can squeeze from it through E = \\nmc\\xe2\\x80\\x98. The white dwarf burns what little there is left at the bottom of the \\ncurve. \\n\\nOur sun will eventually turn into a white dwarf and, over billions of \\nyears, slowly die as it exhausts its nuclear fuel. It will eventually become \\na dark, burned-out dwarf star. However, it is believed that if a star is \\nsufficiently massive (several times the mass of our sun), then most of the \\nelements in the white dwarf will continue to be fused into increasingly \\nheavier elements, eventually reaching iron. Once we reach iron, we are \\nnear the very bottom of the curve. We can no longer extract any more \\nenergy from the excess mass, so the nuclear furnace shuts off. Gravity \\nonce again takes over, crushing the star until temperatures rise explo- \\nsively a thousandfold, reaching trillions of degrees. At this point, the \\niron core collapses and the outer layer of the white dwarf blows off, \\nreleasing the largest burst of energy known in the galaxy, an exploding \\nstar called a supernova. Just one supernova can temporarily outshine an \\nentire galaxy of 100 billion stars. \\n\\nIn the aftermath of the supernova, we find a totally dead star, a neu- \\ntron sfar about the size of Manhattan. The densities in a neutron star are \\nso great that, crudely speaking, all the neutrons are \"touching\" one \\nanother. Although neutron stars are almost invisible, we can still detect \\nthem with our instruments. Because they emit some radiation while they \\nare rotating, they act like a cosmic lighthouse in outer space. We see \\nthem as a blinking star, or pulsar. (Although this scenario sounds like \\nscience fiction, well over 400 pulsars have been observed since their \\ninitial discovery in 1967.) \\n\\nComputer calculations have shown that most of the heavier elements \\nbeyond iron can be synthesized in the heat and pressure of a supernova. \\nWhen the star explodes, it releases vast amounts of stellar debris, con- \\nsisting of the higher elements, into the vacuum of space. This debris \\neventually mixes with other gases, until enough hydrogen gas is accu- \\n\\n\\n\\nBlack Holes and Parallel Universes \\n\\n\\n221 \\n\\n\\nmulated to begin the gravitational contraction process once again. Sec- \\nond-generation stars that are born out of this stellar gas and dust contain \\nan abundance of heavy elements. Some of these stars (like our sun) will \\nhave planets surrounding them that also contain these heavy elements. \\n\\nThis solves a long-standing mystery in cosmology. Our bodies are \\nmade of heavy elements beyond iron, but our sun is not hot enough to \\nforge them. If the earth and the atoms of our bodies were originally \\nfrom the same gas cloud, then where did the heavy elements of our \\nbodies come from? The conclusion is inescapable: The heavy elements \\nin our bodies were synthesized in a supernova that blew up before our \\nsun was created. In other words, a nameless supernova exploded billions \\nofyears ago, seeding the original gas cloud that created our solar system. \\n\\nThe evolution of a star can be roughly pictured as a pinball machine, \\nas in Figure 10.1, with the shape of the binding energy curve. The ball \\nstarts at the top and bounces from hydrogen, to helium, from the lighter \\nelements to the heavier elements. Each time it bounces along the curve, \\nit becomes a different type of star. Finally, the ball bounces to the bottom \\nof the curve, where it lands on iron, and is ejected explosively in a super- \\nnova. Then as this stellar material is collected again into a new hydrogen- \\nrich star, the process starts all over again on the pinball. \\n\\nNotice, however, that there are two ways for the pinball to bounce \\ndown the curve. It can also start at the other side of the curve, at ura- \\nnium, and go down the curve in a single bounce by fissioning the ura- \\nnium nucleus into fragments. Since the average weight of the protons \\nin fission products, like cesium and krypton, is smaller than the average \\nweight of the protons in uranium, the excess mass has been converted \\ninto energy via E = me 1 . This is the source of energy behind the atomic \\nbomb. \\n\\nThus the curve of binding energy not only explains the birth and \\ndeath of stars and the creation of the elements, but also makes possible \\nthe existence ofhydrogen and atomic bombs! (Scientists are often asked \\nwhether it would be possible to develop nuclear bombs other than \\natomic and hydrogen bombs. From the curve of binding energy, we can \\nsee that the answer is no. Notice that the curve excludes the possibility \\nof bombs made of oxygen or iron. These elements are near the bottom \\nof the curve, so there is not enough excess mass to create a bomb. The \\nvarious bombs mentioned in the press, such as neutron bombs, are only \\nvariations on uranium and hydrogen bombs.) \\n\\nWhen one first hears the life history of stars, one may be a bit skep- \\ntical. After all, no one has ever lived 10 billion years to witness their \\nevolution. However, since there are uncountable stars in the heavens, it \\n\\n\\n\\n222 \\n\\n\\nWORMHOLES: GATEWAYS TO ANOTHER UNIVERSE? \\n\\n\\nis a simple matter to see stars at practically every stage in their evolution. \\n(For example, the 1987 supernova, which was visible to the naked eye \\nin the southern hemisphere, yielded a treasure trove of astronomical \\ndata that matched the theoretical predictions of a collapsing dwarf with \\nan iron core. Also, the spectacular supernova observed by ancient Chi- \\nnese astronomers on July 4, 1054, left behind a remnant, which has now \\nbeen identified as a neutron star.) \\n\\nIn addition, our computer programs have become so accurate that \\nwe can essentially predict the sequence of stellar evolution numerically. \\nI once had a roommate in graduate school who was an astronomy major. \\nHe would invariably disappear in the early morning and return late at \\nnight. Just before he would leave, he would say that he was putting a star \\nin the oven to watch it grow. At first, I thought he said this in jest. \\nHowever, when I pressed him on this point, he said with all seriousness \\nthat he was putting a star into the computer and watching it evolve \\nduring the day. Since the thermodynamic equations and the fusion \\nequations were well known, it wasjust a matter of telling the computer \\nto start with a certain mass of hydrogen gas and then letting it numeri- \\ncally solve for the evolution of this gas. In this way, we can check that \\nour theory of stellar evolution can reproduce the known stages of star \\nlife that we see in the heavens with our telescopes. \\n\\n\\nBlack Holes \\n\\nIf a star was ten to 50 times the size of our sun, then gravity will continue \\nto squeeze it even after it becomes a neutron star. Without the force of \\nfusion to repel the gravitational pull, there is nothing to oppose the final \\ncollapse of the star. At this point, it becomes the famous black hole. \\n\\nIn some sense, black holes must exist. A star, we recall, is the by- \\nproduct of two cosmic forces: gravity, which tries to crush the star, and \\nfusion, which tries to blow the star apart like in a hydrogen bomb. All \\nthe various phases in the life history of a star are a consequence of this \\ndelicate balancing act between gravity and fusion. Sooner or later, when \\nall the nuclear fuel in a massive star is finally exhausted and the star is \\na mass of pure neutrons, there is nothing known that can then resist the \\npowerful force of gravity. Eventually, the gravitational force will take over \\nand crush the neutron star into nothingness. The star has come full \\ncircle: It was born when gravity first began to compress hydrogen gas in \\nthe heavens into a star, and it will die when the nuclear fuel is exhausted \\nand gravity collapses it. \\n\\n\\n\\nBlack Holes and Parallel Universes \\n\\n\\n223 \\n\\n\\nThe density of a black hole is so large that light, like a rocket \\nlaunched from the earth, will be forced to orbit around it. Since no light \\ncan escape from the enormous gravitational field, the collapsed star \\nbecomes black in color. In fact, that is the usual definition of a black \\nhole, a collapsed star from which no light can escape. \\n\\nTo understand this, we note that all heavenly bodies have what is \\ncalled an escape velocity. This is the velocity necessary to escape perma- \\nnently the gravitational pull of that body. For example, a space probe \\nmust reach an escape velocity of 25,000 miles per hour in order to leave \\nthe gravitational pull of the earth and go into deep space. Our space \\nprobes like the Voyager that have ventured into deep space and have \\ncompletely left the solar system (carrying good-will messages to any \\naliens who might pick them up) have reached the escape velocity of our \\nsun. (The fact that we breathe oxygen is because the oxygen atoms do \\nnot have enough velocity to escape the earth\\'s gravitational field. The \\nfact that Jupiter and the other gas giants are made mainly of hydrogen \\nis because their escape velocity is large enough to capture the primordial \\nhydrogen of the early solar system. Thus escape velocity helps to explain \\nthe planetary evolution of the planets of our solar system over the past \\n5 billion years.) \\n\\nNewton\\'s theory of gravity, in fact, gives the precise relationship \\nbetween the escape velocity and the mass of the star. The heavier the \\nplanet or star and the smaller its radius, the larger the escape velocity \\nnecessary to escape its gravitational pull. As early as 1783, the English \\nastronomer John Michell used this calculation to propose that a super \\nmassive star might have an escape velocity equal to the speed of light. \\nThe light emitted by such a massive star could never escape, but would \\norbit around it. Thus, to an outside observer, the star would appear \\ntotally black. Using the best knowledge available in the eighteenth cen- \\ntury, he actually calculated the mass of such a black hole.* Unfortu- \\nnately, his theory was considered to be crazy and was soon forgotten. \\nNevertheless, today we tend to believe that black holes exist because our \\ntelescopes and instruments have seen white dwarfs and neutron stars in \\nthe heavens. \\n\\nThere are two ways to explain why black holes are black. From the \\n\\n*In the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society, he wrote, \"If the semi-diameter of \\na sphere of the same density with the Sun were to exceed that of the Sun in the proportion \\nof 500 to 1, a body falling from an infinite height towards it, would have acquired at its \\nsurface greater velocity than that of light, and consequently supposing light to be attracted \\nby the same force in proportion to its vis inertiae, with other bodies, all light emitted from \\nsuch a body would be made to return to it by its own proper gravity.\\'\" \\n\\n\\n\\n224 \\n\\n\\nWORMHOLES: GATEWAYS TO ANOTHER UNIVERSE? \\n\\n\\npedestrian point of view, the \"force\" between the star and a light beam \\nis so great that its path is bent into a circle. Or one can take the Ein- \\nsteinian point of view, in which case the \"shortest distance between two \\npoints is a curved line.\" Bending a light beam into a full circle means \\nthat space itself has been bent full circle. This can happen only if the \\nblack hole has completely pinched a piece of space-time along with it, \\nso the light beam is circulating in a hypersphere. This piece of space- \\ntime has now disconnected itself from the space-time around it. Space \\nitself has now \"ripped.\" \\n\\n\\nThe Einstein-Rosen Bridge \\n\\nThe relativistic description of the black hole comes from the work of \\nKarl Schwarzschild. In 1916, barely a few months after Einstein wrote \\ndown his celebrated equations, Schwarzschild was able to solve Einstein\\'s \\nequations exactly and calculate the gravitational field of a massive, sta- \\ntionary star. \\n\\nSchwarzschild\\'s solution has several interesting features. First, a \\n\"point of no return\" surrounds the black hole. Any object that comes \\ncloser than this radius will inevitably be sucked into the black hole, with \\nno possibility of escape. Inexorably, any person unfortunate enough to \\ncome within the Schwarzschild radius would be captured by the black \\nhole and crushed to death. Today, this distance from the black hole is \\ncalled the Schwarzschild radius, or the horizon (the farthest visible point). \\n\\nSecond, anyone who fell within the Schwarzschild radius would be \\naware of a \"mirror universe\" on the \"other side\" ofspace-time (Figure \\n10.2). Einstein was not worried about the existence of this bizarre mirror \\nuniverse because communication with it was impossible. Any space \\nprobe sent into the center of a black hole would encounter infinite \\ncurvature; that is, the gravitational field would be infinite, and any mate- \\nrial object would be crushed. The electrons would be ripped off atoms, \\nand even the protons and neutrons within the nuclei themselves would \\nbe torn apart. Also, to penetrate through to the alternative universe, the \\nprobe would have to go faster than the speed of light, which is not \\npossible. Thus although this mirror universe is mathematically necessary \\nto make sense of the Schwarzschild solution, it could never be observed \\nphysically. \\n\\nConsequently, the celebrated Einstein-Rosen bridge connecting these \\ntwo universes (named after Einstein and his collaborator, Nathan \\nRosen) was considered a mathematical quirk. The bridge was necessary \\n\\n\\n\\nBlack Holes and Parallel Universes \\n\\n\\n225 \\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 10.2. The Einstein-Rosen bridge connects two different universes. Ein- \\nstein believed that any rocket that entered the bridge would be crushed, thereby \\nmaking communication between these two universes impossible. However, more \\nrecent calculations show that travel through the bridge might be very difficult, but \\nperhaps possible. \\n\\nto have a mathematically consistent theory of the black hole, but it was \\nimpossible to reach the mirror universe by traveling through the Ein- \\nstein-Rosen bridge. Einstein-Rosen bridges were soon found in other \\nsolutions of the gravitational equations, such as the Reissner-Nordstrom \\nsolution describing an electrically charged black hole. However, the Ein- \\n\\n\\n226 \\n\\n\\nWORMHOLES: GATEWAYS TO ANOTHER UNIVERSE? \\n\\n\\nstein-Rosen bridge remained a curious but forgotten footnote in the \\nlore of relativity. \\n\\nThings began to change with the work of New Zealand mathemati- \\ncian Roy Kerr, who in 1963 found another exact solution to Einstein\\'s \\nequations. Kerr assumed that any collapsing star would be rotating. Like \\na spinning skater who speeds up when bringing in his or her hands, a \\nrotating star would necessarily accelerate as it began to collapse. Thus \\nthe stationary Schwarzschild solution for a black hole was not the most \\nphysically relevant solution of Einstein\\'s equations. \\n\\nKerr\\'s solution created a sensation in the field of relativity when it \\nwas proposed. Astrophysicist Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar once said, \\n\\n\\nIn my entire scientific life, extending over forty-five years, the most shat- \\ntering experience has been the realization that an exact solution of Ein- \\nstein\\'s equations ofgeneral relativity, discovered by the New Zealand math- \\nematician Roy Kerr, provides the absolutely exact representation of untold \\nnumbers of massive black holes that populate the universe. This \"shud- \\ndering before the beautiful,\" this incredible fact that a discovery motivated \\nby a search after the beautiful in mathematics should find its exact replica \\nin Nature, persuades me to say that beauty is that to which the human \\nmind responds at its deepest and most profound level . 3 \\n\\n\\nKerr found, however, that a massive rotating star does not collapse \\ninto a point. Instead, the spinning star flattens until it eventually is com- \\npressed into a ring, which has interesting properties. If a probe were \\nshot into the black hole from the side, it would hit the ring and be totally \\ndemolished. The curvature of space-time is still infinite when approach- \\ning the ring from the side. There is still a \"ring of death,\" so to speak, \\nsurrounding the center. However, if a space probe were shot into the \\nring from the top or bottom, it would experience a large but finite cur- \\nvature; that is, the gravitational force would not be infinite. \\n\\nThis rather surprising conclusion from Kerr\\'s solution means that \\nany space probe shot through a spinning black hole along its axis of \\nrotation might, in principle, survive the enormous but finite gravita- \\ntional fields at the center, and go right on through to the mirror universe \\nwithout being destroyed by infinite curvature. The Einstein-Rosen \\nbridge acts like a tunnel connecting two regions of space-time; \\nit is a wormhole. Thus the Kerr black hole is a gateway to another \\nuniverse. \\n\\nNow imagine that your rocket has entered the Einstein-Rosen \\nbridge. As your rocket approaches the spinning black hole, it sees a \\n\\n\\n\\nBlack Holes and Parallel Universes \\n\\n\\n227 \\n\\n\\nring-shaped spinning star. At first, it appears that the rocket is headed \\nfor a disastrous crash landing as it descends toward the black hole from \\nthe north pole. However, as we get closer to the ring, light from the \\nmirror universe reaches our sensors. Since all electromagnetic radiation, \\nincluding radar, orbits the black hole, our radar screens are detecting \\nsignals that have been circulating around the black hole a number of \\ntimes. This effect resembles a hall of mirrors, in which we are fooled by \\nthe multiple images that surround us. Light goes ricocheting across \\nnumerous mirrors, creating the illusion that there are numerous copies \\nof ourselves in the hall. \\n\\nThe same effect occurs as we pass through the Kerr black hole. \\nBecause the same light beam orbits the black hole numerous times, our \\nrocket\\'s radar detects images that have gone spinning around the black \\nhole, creating the illusion of objects that aren\\'t really there. \\n\\n\\nWarp Factor 5 \\n\\nDoes this mean that black holes can be used for travel throughout the \\ngalaxy, as in Star Trek and other science-fiction movies? \\n\\nAs we saw earlier, the curvature in a certain space is determined by \\nthe amount of matter-energy contained in that space (Mach\\'s princi- \\nple). Einstein\\'s famous equation gives us the precise degree of space- \\ntime bending caused by the presence of matter-energy. \\n\\nWhen Captain Kirk takes us soaring through hyperspace at \"warp \\nfactor 5,\" the \"dilithium crystals\" that power the Enterprise must perform \\nmiraculous feats of warping space and time. This means that the dili- \\nthium crystals have the magical power of bending the space-time con- \\ntinuum into pretzels; that is, they are tremendous storehouses of matter \\nand energy. \\n\\nIf the Enterprise travels from the earth to the nearest star, it does not \\nphysically move to Alpha Centauri \\xe2\\x80\\x94 rather. Alpha Centauri comes to \\nthe Enterprise. Imagine sitting on a rug and lassoing a table several feet \\naway. If we are strong enough and the floor is slick enough, we can pull \\nthe lasso until the carpet begins to fold underneath us. If we pull hard \\nenough, the table comes to us, and the \"distance\" between the table \\nand us disappears into a mass of crumpled carpeting. Then we simply \\nhop across this \"carpet warp.\" In other words, we have hardly moved; \\nthe space between us and the table has contracted, and we just step \\nacross this contracted distance. Similarly, the Enterprise does not really \\ncross the entire space to Alpha Centauri; it simply moves across the crum- \\n\\n\\n\\n228 \\n\\n\\nWORMHOLES: GATEWAYS TO ANOTHER UNIVERSE? \\n\\n\\npled space-time \\xe2\\x80\\x94 through a wormhole. To better understand what hap- \\npens when one falls down the Einstein-Rosen bridge, let us now discuss \\nthe topology of wormholes. \\n\\nTo visualize these multiply connected spaces, imagine that we are \\nstrolling down New York\\'s Fifth Avenue one bright afternoon, minding \\nour own business, when a strange floating window opens up in front of \\nus, much like Alice\\'s looking glass. (Never mind for the moment that \\nthe energy necessary to open this window might be enough to shatter \\nthe earth. This is a purely hypothetical example.) \\n\\nWe step up to the hovering window to take a closer look, and are \\nhorrified to find ourselves staring at the head of a nasty-looking Tyran- \\nnosaurus rex. We are about to run for our lives, when we notice that the \\ntyrannosaur has no body. He can\\'t hurt us because his entire body is \\nclearly on the other side of the window. When we look below the window \\nto find the dinosaur\\'s body, we can see all the way down the street, as \\nthough the dinosaur and the window weren\\'t there at all. Puzzled, we \\nslowly circle the window and are relieved to find that the tyrannosaur is \\nnowhere to be found. However, when we peer into the window from the \\nback side, we see the head of a brontosaur staring us in the face (Figure \\n10 . 3 )! \\n\\nFrightened, we walk around the window once more, staring at the \\nwindow sideways. Much to our surprise, all traces of the window, the \\ntyrannosaur, and the brontosaur are gone. We now take a few more turns \\naround the floating window. From one direction, we see the head of the \\ntyrannosaur. From the other direction, we see the head of the bronto- \\nsaur. And when we look from the side, we find that both the mirror and \\nthe dinosaurs have disappeared. \\n\\nWhat\\'s happening? \\n\\nIn some faraway universe, the tyrannosaur and the brontosaur have \\nsquared off in a life-and-death confrontation. As they face each other, a \\nfloating window suddenly appears between them. When the tyrannosaur \\npeers into the floating mirror, he is startled to see the head of a puny, \\nskinny-looking mammal, with frizzy hair and a tiny face: a human. The \\nhead is clearly visible, but it has no body. However, when the brontosaur \\nstares into the same window from the other direction, he sees Fifth Ave- \\nnue, with its shops and traffic. Then the tyrannosaur finds that this \\nhuman creature in the window has disappeared, only to appear on the \\nside of the window facing the brontosaur. \\n\\nNow let us say that suddenly the wind blows our hat into the window. \\nWe see the hat sailing into the sky of the other universe, but it is nowhere \\nto be seen along Fifth Avenue. We take one long gulp, and then, in \\n\\n\\n\\nBlack Holes and Parallel Universes \\n\\n\\n229 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 10.3. In this purely hypothetical example, a \" window \" or wormhole has \\nopened up in our universe. If we look into the window from one direction, we see \\none dinosaur. If we look into the other side of the window, we see another dinosaur. \\nAs seen from the other universe, a window has opened up between the two dino- \\nsaurs. Inside the window, the dinosaurs see a strange small animal (us). \\n\\ndesperation, we stick our hand into the window to retrieve the hat. As \\nseen by the tyrannosaur, a hat blows out the window, appearing from \\nnowhere. Then he sees a disembodied hand reaching out the window, \\ndesperately groping for the hat. \\n\\nThe wind now changes direction, and the hat is carried in the other \\n\\n\\n230 \\n\\n\\nWORMHOLES: GATEWAYS TO ANOTHER UNIVERSE? \\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 10.4. If we insert our hands into the window from two different directions, \\nthen it appears as though our hands have disappeared. We have a body, but no \\nhands. In the alternative universe, two hands have emerged from either side of \\nthe window but they are not attached to a body. \\n\\ndirection. We stick our other hand into the window, but from the other \\nside. We are now in an awkward position. Both our hands are sticking \\ninto the window, but from different sides. But we can\\'t see our fingers. \\nInstead, it appears to us that both hands have disappeared. \\n\\nHow does this appear to the dinosaurs? They see two wiggling, tiny \\nhands dangling from the window, from either side. But there is no body \\n(Figure 10.4). \\n\\nThis example illustrates some of the delicious distortions of space \\nand time that one can invent with multiply connected spaces. \\n\\n\\nBlack Holes and Parallel Universes \\n\\n\\n231 \\n\\n\\nClosing the Wormhole \\n\\nIt seems remarkable that such a simple idea \\xe2\\x80\\x94 that higher dimensions \\ncan unify space with time, and that a \"force\" can be explained by the \\nwarping of that space-time \\xe2\\x80\\x94 would lead to such a rich diversity of phys- \\nical consequences. However, with the wormhole and multiply connected \\nspaces, we are probing the very limits of Einstein\\'s theory of general \\nrelativity. In fact, the amount of matter-energy necessary to create a \\nwormhole or dimensional gateway is so large that we expect quantum \\neffects to dominate. Quantum corrections, in turn, may actually close \\nthe opening of the wormhole, making travel through the gateway impos- \\nsible. \\n\\nSince neither quantum theory nor relativity is powerful enough to \\nsettle this question, we will have to wait until the ten-dimensional theory \\nis completed to decide whether these wormholes are physically relevant \\norjust another crazy idea. However, before we discuss the question of \\nquantum corrections and the ten-dimensional theory, let us now pause \\nand consider perhaps the most bizarre consequence of wormholes. Just \\nas physicists can show that wormholes allow for multiply connected \\nspaces, we can also show that they allow for time travel as well. \\n\\nLet us now consider perhaps the most fascinating, and speculative, \\nconsequence of multiply connected universes: building a time machine. \\n\\n\\n\\nTo Build a Time Machine \\n\\n\\nPeople like us, who believe in physics, know that the distinc- \\ntion between past, present, and future is only a stubbornly \\npersistent illusion. \\n\\nAlbert Einstein \\n\\n\\nTime Travel \\n\\n\\n\\xe2\\x96\\xa0 \\'AN we go backward in time? \\n\\nLike the protagonist in H. G. Wells\\'s The Time Machine, can we \\nspin the dial of a machine and leap hundreds of thousands of years to \\nthe year 802,701? Or, like Michael J. Fox, can we hop into our pluto- \\nnium-fired cars and go back to the future? \\n\\nThe possibility of time travel opens up a vast world of interesting \\npossibilities. Like Kathleen Turner in Peggy Sue Got Married, everyone \\nharbors a secret wish somehow to relive the past and correct some small \\nbut vital mistake in one\\'s life. In Robert Frost\\'s poem \"The Road Not \\nTaken,\" we wonder what might have happened, at keyjunctures in our \\nlives, if we had made different choices and taken another path. With \\ntime travel, we could go back to our youth and erase embarrassing events \\nfrom our past, choose a different mate, or enter different careers; or we \\ncould even change the outcome of key historical events and alter the \\nfate of humanity. \\n\\nFor example, in the climax of Superman, our hero is emotionally dev- \\nastated when an earthquake ravages most of California and crushes his \\n\\n\\n232 \\n\\n\\n\\nTo Build a Time Machine \\n\\n\\n233 \\n\\n\\nlover under hundreds of tons of rock and debris. Mourning her horrible \\ndeath, he is so overcome by anguish that he rockets into space and vio- \\nlates his oath not to tamper with the course of human history. He \\nincreases his velocity until he shatters the light barrier, disrupting the \\nfabric of space and time. By traveling at the speed of light, he forces \\ntime to slow down, then to stop, and finally to go backward, to a time \\nbefore Lois Lane was crushed to death. \\n\\nThis trick, however, is clearly not possible. Although time does slow \\ndown when you increase your velocity, you cannot go faster than the \\nspeed of light (and hence make time go backward) because special rel- \\nativity states that your mass would become infinite in the process. Thus \\nthe faster-than-light travel method preferred by most science-fiction writ- \\ners contradicts the special theory of relativity. \\n\\nEinstein himself was well aware of this impossibility, as was \\nA. H. R. Buller when he published the following limerick in Punch\\': \\n\\n\\nThere was a young lady girl named Bright, \\n\\nWhose speed was far faster than light, \\n\\nShe traveled one day, \\n\\nIn a relative way, \\n\\nAnd returned on the previous night. \\n\\nMost scientists, who have not seriously studied Einstein\\'s equations, \\ndismiss time travel as poppycock, with as much validity as lurid accounts \\nof kidnappings by space aliens. However, the situation is actually quite \\ncomplex. \\n\\nTo resolve the question, we must leave the simpler theory of special \\nrelativity, which forbids time travel, and embrace the full power of the \\ngeneral theory of relativity, which may permit it. General relativity has \\nmuch wider validity than special relativity. While special relativity \\ndescribes only objects moving at constant velocity far away from any stars, \\nthe general theory of relativity is much more powerful, capable of \\ndescribing rockets accelerating near supermassive stars and black holes. \\nThe general theory therefore supplants some of the simpler conclusions \\nof the special theory. For any physicist who has seriously analyzed the \\nmathematics of time travel within Einstein\\'s general theory of relativity, \\nthe final conclusion is, surprisingly enough, far from clear. \\n\\nProponents of time travel point out that Einstein\\'s equations for gen- \\neral relativity do allow some forms of time travel. They acknowledge, \\nhowever, that the energies necessary to twist time into a circle are so \\ngreat that Einstein\\'s equations break down. In the physically interesting \\n\\n\\n\\n234 \\n\\n\\nWORMHOLES: GATEWAYS TO ANOTHER UNIVERSE? \\n\\n\\nregion where time travel becomes a serious possibility, quantum theory \\ntakes over from general relativity. \\n\\nEinstein\\'s equations, we recall, state that the curvature or bending \\nof space and time is determined by the matter-energy content of the \\nuniverse. It is, in fact, possible to find configurations of matter-energy \\npowerful enough to force the bending of time and allow for time travel. \\nHowever, the concentrations of matter-energy necessary to bend time \\nbackward are so vast that general relativity breaks down and quantum \\ncorrections begin to dominate over relativity. Thus the final verdict on \\ntime travel cannot be answered within the framework ofEinstein\\'s equa- \\ntions, which break down in extremely large gravitational fields, where \\nwe expect quantum theory to become dominant. \\n\\nThis is where the hyperspace theory can settle the question. Because \\nboth quantum theory and Einstein\\'s theory of gravity are united in ten- \\ndimensional space, we expect that the question of time travel will be \\nsettled decisively by the hyperspace theory. As in the case of wormholes \\nand dimensional windows, the final chapter will be written when we \\nincorporate the full power of the hyperspace theory. \\n\\nLet us now describe the controversy surrounding time travel and the \\ndelicious paradoxes that inevitably arise. \\n\\n\\nCollapse of Causality \\n\\nScience-fiction writers have often wondered what might happen if a sin- \\ngle individual went back in time. Many of these stories, on the surface, \\nappear plausible. But imagine the chaos that would arise if time \\nmachines were as common as automobiles, with tens of millions of them \\ncommercially available. Havoc would soon break loose, tearing at the \\nfabric of our universe. Millions of people would go back in time to med- \\ndle with their own past and the past of others, rewriting history in the \\nprocess. A few might even go back in time armed with guns to shoot \\ndown the parents of their enemies before they were born. It would thus \\nbe impossible to take a simple census to see how many people there were \\nat any given time. \\n\\nIf time travel is possible, then the laws of causality crumble. In fact, \\nall of history as we know it might collapse as well. Imagine the chaos \\ncaused by thousands of people going back in time to alter key events \\nthat changed the course of history. All of a sudden, the audience at \\nFord\\'s Theater would be crammed with people from the future bicker- \\ning among themselves to see who would have the honor of preventing \\n\\n\\n\\nTo Build a Time Machine \\n\\n\\n235 \\n\\n\\nLincoln\\'s assassination. The landing at Normandy would be botched as \\nthousands of thrill seekers with cameras arrived to take pictures. \\n\\nThe key battlefields of history would be changed beyond recognition. \\nConsider Alexander the Great\\'s decisive victory over the Persians, led by \\nDarius III, in 331 B.C. at the Battle of Gaugamela. This battle led to the \\ncollapse of the Persian forces and ended their rivalry with the West, \\nwhich helped allow the flourishing of Western civilization and culture \\nover the world for the next 1,000 years. But consider what would happen \\nif a small band of armed mercenaries equipped with small rockets and \\nmodern artillery were to enter the battle. The slightest display ofmodern \\nfirepower would rout Alexander\\'s terrified soldiers. This meddling in \\nthe past would cripple the expansion ofWestern influence in the world. \\n\\nTime travel would mean that any historical event could never be \\ncompletely resolved. History books could never be written. Some die- \\nhard would always be trying to assassinate General Ulysses S. Grant or \\ngive the secret of the atomic bomb to the Germans in the 1930s. \\n\\nWhat would happen if history could be rewritten as casually as erasing \\na blackboard? Our past would be like the shifting sands at the seashore, \\nconstantly blown this way or that by the slightest breeze. History would \\nbe constantly changing every time someone spun the dial of a time \\nmachine and blundered his or her way into the past. History, as we know \\nit, would be impossible. It would cease to exist. \\n\\nMost scientists obviously do not relish this unpleasant possibility. Not \\nonly would it be impossible for historians to make any sense out of \"his- \\ntory,\" but genuine paradoxes immediately arise whenever we enter the \\npast or future. Cosmologist Stephen Hawking, in fact, has used this sit- \\nuation to provide \"experimental\" evidence that time travel is not \\npossible. He believes that time travel is not possible by \"the \\nfact that we have not been invaded by hoardes of tourists from the \\nfuture.\" \\n\\n\\nTime Paradoxes \\n\\nTo understand the problems with time travel, it is first necessary to clas- \\nsify the various paradoxes. In general, most can be broken down into \\none of two principal types: \\n\\n1. Meeting your parents before you are born \\n\\n2. The man with no past \\n\\n\\n\\n236 \\n\\n\\nWORMHOLES: GATEWAYS TO ANOTHER UNIVERSE? \\n\\n\\nThe first type of time travel does the most damage to the fabric of \\nspace-time because it alters previously recorded events. For example, \\nremember that in Back to the Future, our young hero goes back in time \\nand meets his mother as a young girl, just before she falls in love with \\nhis father. To his shock and dismay, he finds that he has inadvertently \\nprevented the fateful encounter between his parents. To make matters \\nworse, his young mother has now become amorously attracted to him! \\nIf he unwittingly prevents his mother and father from falling in love and \\nis unable to divert his mother\\'s misplaced affections, he will disappear \\nbecause his birth will never happen. \\n\\nThe second paradox involves events without any beginning. For \\nexample, let\\'s say that an impoverished, struggling inventor is trying to \\nconstruct the world\\'s first time machine in his cluttered basement. Out \\nof nowhere, a wealthy, elderly gentleman appears and offers him ample \\nfunds and the complex equations and circuitry to make a time machine. \\nThe inventor subsequently enriches himself with the knowledge of time \\ntravel, knowing beforehand exactly when stock-market booms and busts \\nwill occur before they happen. He makes a fortune betting on the stock \\nmarket, horse races, and other events. Decades later, as a wealthy, aging \\nman, he goes back in time to fulfill his destiny. He meets himself as a \\nyoung man working in his basement, and gives his younger self the secret \\nof time travel and the money to exploit it. The question is: Where did \\nthe idea of time travel come from? \\n\\nPerhaps the craziest of these time travel paradoxes of the second type \\nwas cooked up by Robert Heinlein in his classic short story \"All You \\nZombies \\xe2\\x80\\x94 . \" \\n\\nA baby girl is mysteriously dropped off at an orphanage in Cleveland \\nin 1945. \"Jane\" grows up lonely and dejected, not knowing who her \\nparents are, until one day in 1963 she is strangely attracted to a drifter. \\nShe falls in love with him. But just when things are finally looking up for \\nJane, a series of disasters strike. First, she becomes pregnant by the \\ndrifter, who then disappears. Second, during the complicated delivery, \\ndoctors find that Jane has both sets of sex organs, and to save her life, \\nthey are forced to surgically convert \"her\" to a \"him.\" Finally, a mys- \\nterious stranger kidnaps her baby from the delivery room. \\n\\nReeling from these disasters, rejected by society, scorned by fate, \\n\"he\" becomes a drunkard and drifter. Not only has Jane lost her parents \\nand her lover, but he has lost his only child as well. Years later, in 1970, \\nhe stumbles into a lonely bar, called Pop\\'s Place, and spills out his \\npathetic story to an elderly bartender. The sympathetic bartender offers \\nthe drifter the chance to avenge the stranger who left her pregnant and \\n\\n\\n\\nTo Build a Time Machine \\n\\n\\n237 \\n\\n\\nabandoned, on the condition that he join the \"time travelers corps.\" \\nBoth of them enter a time machine, and the bartender drops off the \\ndrifter in 1963. The drifter is strangely attracted to a young orphan \\nwoman, who subsequently becomes pregnant. \\n\\nThe bartender then goes forward 9 months, kidnaps the baby girl \\nfrom the hospital, and drops off the baby in an orphanage back in 1945. \\nThen the bartender drops off the thoroughly confused drifter in 1985, \\nto enlist in the time travelers corps. The drifter eventually gets his life \\ntogether, becomes a respected and elderly member of the time travelers \\ncorps, and then disguises himself as a bartender and has his most diffi- \\ncult mission: a date with destiny, meeting a certain drifter at Pop\\'s Place \\nin 1970. \\n\\nThe question is: Who is Jane\\'s mother, father, grandfather, grand- \\nmother, son, daughter, granddaughter, and grandson? The girl, the \\ndrifter, and the bartender, of course, are all the same person. These \\nparadoxes can made your head spin, especially if you try to untangle \\nJane\\'s twisted parentage. If we draw Jane\\'s family tree, we find that all \\nthe branches are curled inward back on themselves, as in a circle. We \\ncome to the astonishing conclusion that she is her own mother and \\nfather! She is an entire family tree unto herself. \\n\\n\\nWorld Lines \\n\\nRelativity gives us a simple method to sort through the thorniest of these \\nparadoxes. We will make use of the \"world line\" method, pioneered by \\nEinstein. \\n\\nFor example, say our alarm clock wakes us up one day at 8:00 A.M., \\nand we decide to spend the morning in bed instead of going to work. \\nAlthough it appears that we are doing nothing by loafing in bed, we are \\nactually tracing out a \"world line.\" \\n\\nTake a sheet of graph paper, and on the horizontal scale put \"dis- \\ntance\" and on the vertical scale put \"time.\" Ifwe simply lie in bed from \\n8:00 to 12:00, our world line is a straight vertical line. We went 4 hours \\ninto the future, but traveled no distance. Even engaging in our favorite \\npastime, doing nothing, creates a world line. (If someone ever criticizes \\nus for loafing, we can truthfully claim that, according to Einstein\\'s theory \\nof relativity, we are tracing out a world line in four-dimensional space- \\ntime.) \\n\\nNow let\\'s say that we finally get out of bed at noon and arrive at work \\nat 1:00 P.M. Our world line becomes slanted because we are moving in \\n\\n\\n\\n238 \\n\\n\\nWORMHOLES: GATEWAYS TO ANOTHER UNIVERSE? \\n\\n\\nspace as well as time. In the lower left corner is our home, and on the \\nupper right is our office (Figure 11.1) If we take the car to work, though, \\nwe arrive at the office earlier, at 12:30. This means that the faster we \\ntravel, the more our world line deviates from the vertical. (Notice that \\nthere is also a \"forbidden region\" in the diagram that our world line \\ncan\\'t enter because we would have to be going faster than the speed of \\nlight.) \\n\\nOne conclusion is immediate. Our world line never really begins or \\nends. Even when we die, the world lines of the molecules in our bodies \\nkeep going. These molecules may disperse into the air or soil, but they \\nwill trace out their own never-ending world lines. Similarly, when we are \\nborn, the world lines of the molecules coming from our mother coalesce \\ninto a baby. At no point do world lines break off or appear from nothing. \\n\\nTo see how this all fits together, take the simple example of our own \\npersonal world line. In 1950, say, our mother and father met, fell in love, \\nand produced a baby (us). Thus the world lines of our mother and father \\ncollided and produced a third world line (ours). Eventually, when some- \\none dies, the world lines forming the person disperse into billions of \\nworld lines of our molecules. From this point of view, a human being \\ncan be defined as a temporary collection of world lines of molecules. \\nThese world lines were scattered before we were born, came together to \\nform our bodies, and will rescatter after we die. The Bible says, \"from \\ndust to dust.\" In this relativistic picture, we might say, \"from world lines \\nto world lines.\" \\n\\nOur world line thus contains the entire body of information con- \\ncerning our history. Everything that ever happened to us \\xe2\\x80\\x94 from our first \\nbicycle, to our first date, to our first job \\xe2\\x80\\x94 is recorded in our world line. \\nIn fact, the great Russian cosmologist George Gamow, who was famous \\nfor approaching Einstein\\'s work with wit and whimsy, aptly titled his \\nautobiography My World Line. \\n\\nWith the aid of the world line, we can now picture what happens \\nwhen we go back in time. Let\\'s say we enter a time machine and meet \\nour mother before we are born. Unfortunately, she falls in love with us \\nand jilts our father. Do we really disappear, as depicted in Back to the \\nFuture? On a world line, we now see why this is impossible. When we \\ndisappear, our world line disappears. However, according to Einstein, \\nworld lines cannot be cut. Thus altering the past is not possible in rel- \\nativity. \\n\\nThe second paradox, involving re-creating the past, poses interesting \\nproblems, however. For example, by going back in time, we are fulfilling \\nthe past, not destroying it. Thus the world line of the inventor of time \\n\\n\\n\\nTime \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n^2 = 00 \\n\\n\\n8:00 \\n\\nDistance \\n\\n1 mile \\n\\n\\nTime \\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 11.1. Our world line summarizes our entire history, from birth to death. \\nFor example, if we lie in bed from 8:00 A.M. to 12:00, our world line is a vertical \\nline. If we travel by car to work, then our world becomes a slanted line. The faster \\nwe move, the more slanted our world line becomes. The fastest we can travel, \\nhowever, is the speed of light. Thus part of this space-time diagram is \"forbidden \\nthat is, we would have to go faster than the speed of light to enter into this \\nforbidden zone. \\n\\n\\n239 \\n\\n\\n\\n240 \\n\\n\\nWORMHOLES: GATEWAYS TO ANOTHER UNIVERSE? \\n\\n\\ntravel is a closed loop. His world line fulfills, rather than changes, the \\npast. \\n\\nMuch more complicated is the world line of \"Jane,\" the woman who \\nis her own mother and father and son and daughter (Figure 11.2). \\n\\nNotice, once again, that we cannot alter the past. When our world \\nline goes back in time, it simply fulfills what is already known. In such a \\nuniverse, therefore, it is possible to meet yourself in the past. If we live \\nthrough one cycle, then sooner or later we meet a young man or woman \\nwho happens to be ourselves when we were younger. We tell this young \\nperson that he or she looks suspiciously familiar. Then, thinking a bit, \\nwe remember that when we were young, we met a curious, older person \\nwho claimed that we looked familiar. \\n\\nThus perhaps we can fulfill the past, but never alter it. World lines, \\nas we have stressed, cannot be cut and cannot end. They can perhaps \\nperform loops in time, but never alter it. \\n\\nThese light cone diagrams, however, have been presented only in the \\nframework of special relativity, which can describe what happens if we \\nenter the past, but is too primitive to settle the question of whether time \\ntravel makes any sense. To answer this larger question, we must turn to \\nthe general theory of relativity, where the situation becomes much more \\ndelicate. \\n\\nWith the full power of general relativity, we see that these twisted \\nworld lines might be physically allowed. These closed loops go by the \\nscientific name closed timelike curves (CTCs). The debate in scientific cir- \\ncles is whether CTCs are allowed by general relativity and quantum \\ntheory. \\n\\n\\nSpoiler of Arithmetic and General Relativity \\n\\nIn 1949, Einstein was concerned about a discovery by one of his close \\ncolleagues and friends, the Viennese mathematician Kurt Godel, also at \\nthe Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton, where Einstein worked. \\nGodel found a disturbing solution to Einstein\\'s equations that allowed \\nfor violations of the basic tenets of common sense: His solution allowed \\nfor certain forms of time travel. For the first time in history, time travel \\nwas given a mathematical foundation. \\n\\nIn some quarters, Godel was known as a spoiler. In 1931, he became \\nfamous (or, actually, infamous) when he proved, contrary to every expec- \\ntation, that you cannot prove the self-consistency of arithmetic. In the \\nprocess, he ruined a 2,000-year-old dream, dating back to Euclid and \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 11.2. If time travel is possible, then our world line becomes a closed loop. \\nIn 1945, the girl is born. In 1963, she has a baby. In 1970, he is a drifter, who \\ngoes back to 1945 to meet himself. In 1985, he is a time traveler, who picks himself \\nup in a bar in 1970, takes himself back to 1945, kidnaps the baby and takes her \\nback to 1945, to start all over again. The girl is her own mother, father, grand- \\nfather, grandmother, son, daughter, and so on. \\n\\n\\n241 \\n\\n\\n\\n242 \\n\\n\\nWORMHOLES: GATEWAYS TO ANOTHER UNIVERSE? \\n\\n\\nthe Greeks, which was to have been the crowning achievement of math- \\nematics: to reduce all of mathematics to a small, self-consistent set of \\naxioms from which everything could be derived. \\n\\nIn a mathematical tour de force, Godel showed that there will always \\nbe theorems in arithmetic whose correctness or incorrectness can never \\nbe demonstrated from the axioms of arithmetic; that is, arithmetic will \\nalways be incomplete. Godel\\'s result was the most startling, unexpected \\ndevelopment in mathematical logic in perhaps a thousand years. \\n\\nMathematics, once thought to be the purest of all sciences because \\nit was precise and certain, untarnished by the unpleasant crudeness of \\nour material world, now became uncertain. After Godel, the fundamen- \\ntal basis for mathematics seemed to be left adrift. (Crudely speaking, \\nGodel\\'s remarkable proof began by showing that there are curious par- \\nadoxes in logic. For example, consider the statement \"This sentence is \\nfalse.\" Ifthe sentence is true, then it follows that it is false. If the sentence \\nis false, then the sentence is true. Or consider the statement \"I am a \\nliar.\" Then I am a liar only if I tell the truth. Godel then formulated the \\nstatement \"This sentence cannot be proved true.\" If the sentence is \\ncorrect, then it cannot be proved to be correct. By carefully building a \\ncomplex web of such paradoxes, Godel showed that there are true state- \\nments that cannot be proved using arithmetic.) \\n\\nAfter demolishing one of the most cherished dreams of all of math- \\nematics, Godel next shattered the conventional wisdom surrounding \\nEinstein\\'s equations. He showed that Einstein\\'s theory contains some \\nsurprising pathologies, including time travel. \\n\\nHe first assumed that the universe was filled with gas or dust that was \\nslowly rotating. This seemed reasonable, since the far reaches of the \\nuniverse do seem to be filled with gas and dust. However, Godel\\'s solu- \\ntion caused great concern for two reasons. \\n\\nFirst, his solution violated Mach\\'s principle. He showed that two solu- \\ntions of Einstein\\'s equations were possible with the same distribution of \\ndust and gas. (This meant that Mach\\'s principle was somehow incom- \\nplete, that hidden assumptions were present.) \\n\\nMore important, he showed that certain forms of time travel were \\npermitted. If one followed the path of a particle in a Godel universe, \\neventually it would come back and meet itself in the past. He wrote, \"By \\nmaking a round trip on a rocket ship in a sufficiently wide curve, it is \\npossible in these worlds to travel into any region of the past, present, \\nand future, and back again. \" Thus Godel found the first CTC in general \\nrelativity. \\n\\nPreviously, Newton considered time to be moving like a straight \\n\\n\\n\\nTo Build a Time Machine \\n\\n\\n243 \\n\\n\\narrow, which unerringly flies forward toward its target. Nothing could \\ndeflect or change the course of this arrow once it was shot. Einstein, \\nhowever, showed that time was more like a mighty river, moving forward \\nbut often meandering through twisting valleys and plains. The presence \\nof matter or energy might momentarily shift the direction of the river, \\nbut overall the river\\'s course was smooth: It never abruptly ended or \\njerked backward. However, Godel showed that the river of time could \\nbe smoothly bent backward into a circle. Rivers, after all, have eddy \\ncurrents and whirlpools. In the main, a river may flow forward, but at \\nthe edges there are always side pools where water flows in a circular \\nmotion. \\n\\nGodel\\'s solution could not be dismissed as the work of a crackpot \\nbecause Godel had used Einstein\\'s own field equations to find strange \\nsolutions in which time bent into a circle. Because Godel had played by \\nthe rules and discovered a legitimate solution to his equations, Einstein \\nwas forced to take the evasive route and dismiss it because it did not fit \\nthe experimental data. \\n\\nThe weak spot in Godel\\'s universe was the assumption that the gas \\nand dust in the universe were slowly rotating. Experimentally, we do not \\nsee any rotation of the cosmic dust and gas in space. Our instruments \\nhave verified that the universe is expanding, but it does not appear to \\nbe rotating. Thus the Godel universe can be safely ruled out. (This leaves \\nus with the rather disturbing, although plausible, possibility that if our \\nuniverse did rotate, as Godel speculated, then CTCs and time travel \\nwould be physically possible.) \\n\\nEinstein died in 1955, content that disturbing solutions to his equa- \\ntions could be swept under the rug for experimental reasons and that \\npeople could not meet their parents before they were born. \\n\\n\\nLiving in the Twilight Zone \\n\\nThen, in 1963, Ezra Newman, Theodore Unti, and Louis Tamburino \\ndiscovered a new solution to Einstein\\'s equations that was even crazier \\nthan Godel\\'s. Unlike the Godel universe, their solution was not based \\non a rotating dust-filled universe. On the surface, it resembled a typical \\nblack hole. \\n\\nAs in the Godel solution, their universe allowed for CTCs and time \\ntravel. Moreover, when -going 360 degrees around the black hole, you \\nwould not wind up where you originally started. Instead, like living on \\na universe with a Riemann cut, you would wind up on another sheet of \\n\\n\\n\\n244 WORMHOLES: GATEWAYS TO ANOTHER UNIVERSE? \\n\\nthe universe. The topology of a Newman-Unti-Tamburino universe \\nmight be compared to living on a spiral staircase. Ifwe move 360 degrees \\naround the staircase, we do not arrive at the same point at which we \\nstarted, but on another landing of the staircase. Living in such a universe \\nwould surpass our worst nightmare, with common sense being com- \\npletely thrown out the window. In fact, this bizarre universe was so patho- \\nlogical that it was quickly coined the NUT universe, after the initials of \\nits creators. \\n\\nAt first, relativists dismissed the NUT solution in the same way they \\nhad dismissed the Godel solution; that is, our universe didn\\'t seem to \\nevolve in the way predicted by these solutions, so they were arbitrarily \\ndiscarded for experimental reasons. However, as the decades went by, \\nthere was a flood of such bizarre solutions to Einstein\\'s equations that \\nallowed for time travel. In the early 1970s, Frank J. Tipler at Tulane \\nUniversity in New Orleans reanalyzed an old solution to Einstein\\'s equa- \\ntions found by W.J. van Stockum in 1936. even before Godel\\'s solution. \\nThis solution assumed the existence of an infinitely long, rotating cyl- \\ninder. Surprisingly enough, Tipler was able to show that this solution \\nalso violated causality. \\n\\nEven the Kerr solution (which represents the most physically realistic \\ndescription of black holes in outer space) was shown to allow for time \\ntravel. Rocket ships that pass through the center of the Kerr black hole \\n(assuming they are not crushed in the process) could violate causality. \\n\\nSoon, physicists found that NUT-type singularities could be inserted \\ninto any black hole or expanding universe. In fact, it now became pos- \\nsible to cook up an infinite number of pathological solutions to Ein- \\nstein\\'s equations. For example, every wormhole solution to Einstein\\'s \\nequations could be shown to allow some form of time travel. \\n\\nAccording to relativist Frank Tipler, \"solutions to the field equations \\ncan be found which exhibit virtually any type ofbizarre behavior.\" 1 Thus \\nan explosion of pathological solutions to Einstein\\'s equations was dis- \\ncovered that certainly would have horrified Einstein had he still been \\nalive. \\n\\nEinstein\\'s equations, in some sense, were like a Trojan horse. On the \\nsurface, the horse looks like a perfectly acceptable gift, giving us the \\nobserved bending of starlight under gravity and a compelling explana- \\ntion of the origin of the universe. However, inside lurk all sorts of strange \\ndemons and goblins, which allow for the possibility of interstellar travel \\nthrough wormholes and time travel. The price we had to pay for peering \\ninto the darkest secrets of the universe was the potential downfall of \\nsome of our most commonly held beliefs about our world \\xe2\\x80\\x94 that its space \\nis simply connected and its history is unalterable. \\n\\n\\n\\nTo Build a Time Machine \\n\\n\\n245 \\n\\n\\nBut the question still remained: Could these CTCs be dismissed on \\npurely experimental grounds, as Einstein did, or could someone show \\nthat they were theoretically possible and then actually build a time \\nmachine? \\n\\n\\nTo Build a Time Machine \\n\\nIn June 1988, three physicists (Kip Thome and Michael Morris at the \\nCalifornia Institute of Technology and Ulvi Yurtsever at the University \\nof Michigan) made the first serious proposal for a time machine. They \\nconvinced the editors of Physical Review Letters, one of the most distin- \\nguished publications in the world, that their work merited serious con- \\nsideration. (Over the decades, scores of crackpot proposals for time \\ntravel have been submitted to mainstream physics journals, but all have \\nbeen rejected because they were not based on sound physical principles \\nor Einstein\\'s equations.) Like experienced scientists, they presented \\ntheir arguments in accepted field theoretical language and then care- \\nfully explained where their weakest assumptions were. \\n\\nTo overcome the skepticism of the scientific community, Thome and \\nhis colleagues realized that they would have to overcome the standard \\nobjections to using wormholes as time machines. First, as mentioned \\nearlier, Einstein himself realized that the gravitational forces at the cen- \\nter of a black hole would be so enormous that any spacecraft would be \\ntorn apart. Although wormholes were mathematically possible, they \\nwere, in practice, useless. \\n\\nSecond, wormholes might be unstable. One could show that small \\ndisturbances in wormholes would cause the Einstein-Rosen bridge to \\ncollapse. Thus a spaceship\\'s presence inside a black hole would be suf- \\nficient to cause a disturbance that would close the entrance to the worm- \\nhole. \\n\\nThird, one would have to go faster than the speed of light actually \\nto penetrate the wormhole to the other side. \\n\\nFourth, quantum effects would be so large that the wormhole might \\nclose by itself. For example, the intense radiation emitted by the \\nentrance to the black hole not only would kill anyone who tried to enter \\nthe black hole, but also might close the entrance. \\n\\nFifth, time slows down in a wormhole and comes to a complete stop \\nat the center. Thus wormholes have the undesirable feature that as seen \\nby someone on the earth, a space traveler appears to slow down and \\ncome to a total halt at the center of the black hole. The space traveler \\nlooks like he or she is frozen in time. In other words, it takes an infinite \\n\\n\\n\\n246 WORMHOLES: GATEWAYS TO ANOTHER UNIVERSE? \\n\\namount of time for a space traveler to go through a wormhole. Assum- \\ning, for the moment, that one could somehow go through the center of \\nthe wormhole and return to earth, the distortion of time would still be \\nso great that millions or even billions of years may have passed on the \\nearth. \\n\\nFor all these reasons, the wormhole solutions were never taken seri- \\nously. \\n\\nThorne is a serious cosmologist, one who might normally view time \\nmachines with extreme skepticism or even derision. However, Thorne \\nwas gradually drawn into this quest in the most curious way. In the sum- \\nmer of 1985, Carl Sagan sent to Thorne the prepublication draft of his \\nnext book, a novel called Contact, which seriously explores the scientific \\nand political questions surrounding an epoch-making event: making \\ncontact with the first extraterrestrial life in outer space. Every scientist \\npondering the question of life in outer space must confront the question \\nof how to break the light barrier. Since Einstein\\'s special theory of rel- \\nativity explicitly forbids travel faster than the speed of light, traveling to \\nthe distant stars in a conventional spaceship may take thousands ofyears, \\nthereby making interstellar travel impractical. Since Sagan wanted to \\nmake his book as scientifically accurate as possible, he wrote to Thorne \\nasking whether there was any scientifically acceptable way of evading the \\nlight barrier. \\n\\nSagan\\'s request piqued Thome\\'s intellectual curiosity. Here was an \\nhonest, scientifically relevant request made by one scientist to another \\nthat demanded a serious reply. Fortunately, because of the unorthodox \\nnature of the request, Thorne and his colleagues approached the ques- \\ntion in a most unusual way: They worked backward. Normally, physicists \\nstart with a certain known astronomical object (a neutron star, a black \\nhole, the Big Bang) and then solve Einstein\\'s equations to find the cur- \\nvature of the surrounding space. The essence of Einstein\\'s equations, \\nwe recall, is that the matter and energy content of an object determines \\nthe amount of curvature in the surrounding space and time. Proceeding \\nin this way, we are guaranteed to find solutions to Einstein\\'s equations \\nfor astronomically relevant objects that we expect to find in outer space. \\n\\nHowever, because of Sagan\\'s strange request, Thorne and his col- \\nleagues approached the question backward. They started with a rough \\nidea of what they wanted to find. They wanted a solution to Einstein\\'s \\nequations in which a space traveler would not be torn apart by the tidal \\neffects of the intense gravitational field. They wanted a wormhole that \\nwould be stable and not suddenly close up in the middle of the trip. \\nThey wanted a wormhole in which the time it takes for a round trip \\n\\n\\n\\nTo Build a Time Machine \\n\\n\\n247 \\n\\n\\nwould be measured in days, not millions or billions of earth years, and \\nso on. In fact, their guiding principle was that they wanted a time traveler \\nto have a reasonably comfortable ride back through time after entering \\nthe wormhole. Once they decided what their wormhole would look like, \\nthen, and only then, did they begin to calculate the amount of energy \\nnecessary to create such a wormhole. \\n\\nFrom their unorthodox point of view, they did not particularly care \\nif the energy requirements were well beyond twentieth-century science. \\nTo them, it was an engineering problem for some future civilization \\nactually to construct the time machine. They wanted to prove that it was \\nscientifically feasible, not that it was economical or within the bounds of \\npresent-day earth science: \\n\\n\\nNormally, theoretical physicists ask, \"What are the laws of physics?\" and/ \\nor \"What do those laws predict about the Universe?\" In this Letter, we \\nask, instead, \"What constraints do the laws ofphysics place on the activities \\nof an arbitrarily advanced civilization?\" This will lead to some intriguing \\nqueries about the laws themselves. We begin by asking whether the laws of \\nphysics permit an arbitrarily advanced civilization to construct and main- \\ntain wormholes for interstellar travel/ \\n\\n\\nThe key phrase, of course, is \"arbitrarily advanced civilization.\" The \\nlaws ofphysics tell us what is possible, not what is practical. The laws of \\nphysics are independent of what it might cost to test them. Thus what is \\ntheoretically possible may exceed the gross national product of the \\nplanet earth. Thorne and his colleagues were careful to state that this \\nmythical civilization that can harness the power of wormholes must be \\n\"arbitrarily advanced\" \\xe2\\x80\\x94 that is, capable of performing all experiments \\nthat are possible (even if they are not practical for earthlings). \\n\\nMuch to their delight, with remarkable ease they soon found a sur- \\nprisingly simple solution that satisfied all their rigid constraints. It was \\nnot a typical black hole solution at all, so they didn\\'t have to worry about \\nall the problems of being ripped apart by a collapsed star. They chris- \\ntened their solution the \"transversible wormhole.\" to distinguish it from \\nthe other wormhole solutions that are not transversible by spaceship. \\nThey were so excited by their solution that they wrote back to Sagan, \\nwho then incorporated some of their ideas in his novel. In fact, they \\nwere so surprised by the simplicity of their solution that they were con- \\nvinced that a beginning graduate student in physics would be able to \\nunderstand their solution. In the autumn of 1985. on the final exam in \\na course on general relativity given at Caltech, Thorne gave the worm- \\n\\n\\n\\n248 \\n\\n\\nWORMHOLES: GATEWAYS TO ANOTHER UNIVERSE? \\n\\n\\nhole solution to the students without telling them what it was, and they \\nwere asked to deduce its physical properties. (Most students gave \\ndetailed mathematical analyses of the solution, but they failed to grasp \\nthat they were looking at a solution that permitted time travel.) \\n\\nIf the students had been a bit more observant on that final exam, \\nthey would have been able to deduce some rather astonishing properties \\nof the wormhole. In fact, they would have found that a trip through this \\ntransversible wormhole would be as comfortable as a trip on an airplane. \\nThe maximum gravitational forces experienced by the travelers would \\nnot exceed 1 g. In other words, their apparent weight would not exceed \\ntheir weight on the earth. Furthermore, the travelers would never have \\nto worry about the entrance of the wormhole closing up during the \\njourney. Thome\\'s wormhole is, in fact, permanently open. Instead of \\ntaking a million or a billion years, a trip through the transversible worm- \\nhole would be manageable. Morris and Thorne write that \"the trip will \\nbe fully comfortable and will require a total of about 200 days,\" or less.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 \\n\\nSo far, Thorne notes that the time paradoxes that one usually \\nencounters in the movies are not to be found: \"From exposure to sci- \\nence fiction scenarios (for example, those in which one goes back in \\ntime and kills oneself) one might expect CTCs to give rise to initial \\ntrajectories with zero multiplicities\" (that is, trajectories that are impos- \\nsible). However, he has shown that the CTCs that appear in his worm- \\nhole seem to fulfill the past, rather than change it or initiate time para- \\ndoxes. \\n\\nFinally, in presenting these surprising results to the scientific com- \\nmunity, Thorne wrote, \"A new class of solutions of the Einstein field \\nequations is presented, which describe wormholes that, in principle, \\ncould be traversed by human beings.\" \\n\\nThere is, of course, a catch to all this, which is one reason why we \\ndo not have time machines today. The last step in Thome\\'s calculation \\nwas to deduce the precise nature of the matter and energy necessary to \\ncreate this marvelous transversible wormhole. Thorne and his colleagues \\nfound that at the center of the wormhole, there must be an \"exotic\" \\nform of matter that has unusual properties. Thorne is quick to point out \\nthat this \"exotic\" form of matter, although unusual, does not seem to \\nviolate any of the known laws of physics. He cautions that, at some future \\npoint, scientists may prove that exotic matter does not exist. However, \\nat present, exotic matter seems to be a perfectly acceptable form of \\nmatter if one has access to sufficiently advanced technology. Thorne \\nwrites confidently that \"from a single wormhole an arbitrarily advanced \\ncivilization can construct a machine for backward time travel.\" \\n\\n\\n\\nTo Build a Time Machine \\n\\n\\n249 \\n\\n\\nBlueprint for a Time Machine \\n\\nAnyone who has read H. G. Wells\\'s The Time Machine, however, may be \\ndisappointed with Thome\\'s blueprint for a time machine. You do not \\nsit in a chair in your living room, turn a few dials, see blinking lights, \\nand witness the vast panorama of history, including destructive world \\nwars, the rise and fall of great civilizations, or the fruits of futuristic \\nscientific marvels. \\n\\nOne version of Thome\\'s time machine consists of two chambers, \\neach containing two parallel metal plates. The intense electric fields \\ncreated between each pair of plates (larger than anything possible with \\ntoday\\'s technology) rips the fabric of space-time, creating a hole in \\nspace that links the two chambers. One chamber is then placed in a \\nrocket ship and is accelerated to near-light velocities, while the other \\nchamber stays on the earth. Since a wormhole can connect two regions \\nof space with different times, a clock in the first chamber ticks slower \\nthan a clock in the second chamber. Because time would pass at dif- \\nferent rates at the two ends of the wormhole, anyone falling into one \\nend of the wormhole would be instantly hurled into the past or the \\nfuture. \\n\\nAnother time machine might look like the following. If exotic matter \\ncan be found and shaped like metal, then presumably the ideal shape \\nwould be a cylinder. A human stands in the center of the cylinder. The \\nexotic matter then warps the space and time surrounding it, creating a \\nwormhole that connects to a distant part of the universe in a different \\ntime. At the center of the vortex is the human, who then experiences \\nno more than 1 g of gravitational stress as he or she is then sucked into \\nthe wormhole and finds himself or herself on the other end of the uni- \\nverse. \\n\\nOn the surface, Thome\\'s mathematical reasoning is impeccable. Ein- \\nstein\\'s equations indeed show that wormhole solutions allow for time to \\npass at different rates on either side of the wormhole, so that time travel, \\nin principle, is possible. The trick, of course, is to create the wormhole \\nin the first place. As Thorne and his collaborators are quick to point \\nout, the main problem is how to harness enough energy to create and \\nmaintain a wormhole with exotic matter. \\n\\nNormally, one of the basic tenets of elementary physics is that all \\nobjects have positive energy. Vibrating molecules, moving cars, flying \\nbirds, and soaring rockets all have positive energy. (By definition, the \\nempty vacuum of space has zero energy.) However, if we can produce \\nobjects with \"negative energies\" (that is, something that has an energy \\n\\n\\n\\n250 \\n\\n\\nWORMHOLES: GATEWAYS TO ANOTHER UNIVERSE? \\n\\n\\ncontent less than the vacuum), then we might be able to generate exotic \\nconfigurations of space and time in which time is bent into a circle. \\n\\nThis rather simple concept goes by a complicated-sounding title: the \\naveraged weak energy condition (AWEC). As Thorne is careful to point out, \\nthe AWEC must be violated; energy must become temporarily negative \\nfor time travel to be successful. However, negative energy has historically \\nbeen anathema to relativists, who realize that negative energy would \\nmake possible antigravity and a host of other phenomena that have \\nnever been seen experimentally. \\n\\nBut Thorne is quick to point out that there is a way to obtain negative \\nenergy, and this is through quantum theory. In 1948, the Dutch physicist \\nHenrik Casimir demonstrated that quantum theory can create negative \\nenergy: Just take two large, uncharged parallel metal plates. Ordinarily, \\ncommon sense tells us that these two plates, because they are electrically \\nneutral, have no force between them. But Casimir proved that the vac- \\nuum separating these two plates, because of the Heisenberg Uncertainty \\nPrinciple, is actually teeming with activity, with trillions of particles and \\nantiparticles constantly appearing and disappearing. They appear out of \\nnowhere and disappear back into the vacuum. Because they are so fleet- \\ning, they are, for the most part, unobservable, and they do not violate \\nany of the laws of physics. These \"virtual particles\" create a net attractive \\nforce between these two plates that Casimir predicted was measurable. \\n\\nWhen Casimir first published his paper, it met with extreme skepti- \\ncism. After all, how can two electrically neutral objects attract each other, \\nthereby violating the usual laws of classical electricity? This was unheard \\nof. However, in 1958 physicist M.J. Sparnaay observed this effect in the \\nlaboratory, exactly as Casimir had predicted. Since then, it has been \\nchristened the Casimir effect. \\n\\nOne way of harnessing the Casimir effect is to place two large con- \\nducting parallel plates at the entrance of each wormhole, thereby cre- \\nating negative energy at each end. As Thorne and his colleagues con- \\nclude, \"It may turn out that the average weak energy condition can never \\nbe violated, in which case there could be no such things as transversible \\nwormholes, time travel, or a failure of causality. It\\'s premature to try to \\ncross a bridge before you come to it.\" 7 \\n\\nAt present, thejury is still out on Thome\\'s time machine. The deci- \\nsive factor, all agree, is to have a fully quantized theory of gravity settle \\nthe matter once and for all. For example, Stephen Hawking has pointed \\nout that the radiation emitted at the wormhole entrance will be quite \\nlarge and will contribute back into the matter-energy content of Ein- \\nstein\\'s equations. This feedback into Einstein\\'s equations will distort the \\n\\n\\n\\nTo Build a Time Machine \\n\\n\\n251 \\n\\n\\nentrance to the wormhole, perhaps even closing it forever. Thorne, how- \\never, disagrees that the radiation will be sufficient to close the entrance. \\n\\nThis is where superstring theory comes in. Because superstring the- \\nory is a fully quantum-mechanical theory that includes Einstein\\'s theory \\nof general relativity as a subset, it can be used to calculate corrections \\nto the original wormhole theory. In principle, it will allow us to deter- \\nmine whether the AWEC condition is physically realizable, and whether \\nthe wormhole entrance stays open for time travelers to enjoy a trip to \\nthe past. \\n\\nHawking has expressed reservations about Thorne\\'s wormholes. \\nHowever, this is ironic because Hawking himself has proposed a new \\ntheory of wormholes that is even more fantastic. Instead of connecting \\nthe present with the past. Hawking proposes to use wormholes to con- \\nnect our universe with an infinite number of parallel universes! \\n\\n\\n\\n12 \\n\\nColliding Universes \\n\\n\\n[Nature is] not only queerer than we suppose, it is queerer \\nthan we can suppose. \\n\\nJ.

But he not \\nonly maintains a vigorous research program, but still took time to write \\na best-selling book, A Brief History of Time, and to lecture around the \\nworld. \\n\\nI once visited Hawking in his home just outside Cambridge University \\nwhen I was invited to speak at a physics conference he was organizing. \\nWalking through his living room, I was surprised by the impressive array \\nofingenious gadgets that he uses to continue his research. For example, \\nI saw on his desk a device much like those used by musicians to hold \\nmusic sheets. This one. however, was much more elaborate and had the \\nability to grab each page and carefully turn it for reading a book. (I \\nshivered to ponder, as I think many physicists have, whether I would \\n\\n\\n252 \\n\\n\\n\\nColliding Universes \\n\\n\\n25 3 \\n\\n\\nhave the stamina and sheer willpower to continue research with- \\nout arms, legs, or a voice even if I had the finest mechanical aids \\navailable.) \\n\\nHawking is the Lucasian Professor of Physics at Cambridge Univer- \\nsity, the same chair held by Isaac Newton. And like his illustrious pred- \\necessor, Hawking has embarked on the greatest quest of the century, \\nthe final unification of Einstein\\'s theory of gravity and quantum theory. \\nAs a result, he, too, has marveled at the elegant, self-consistency of the \\nten-dimensional theory, and in fact closes his best-selling book with a \\ndiscussion of it. \\n\\nHawking no longer spends the bulk of his creative energy on the \\nfield that made him world-famous \\xe2\\x80\\x94 black holes \\xe2\\x80\\x94 which are by now \\npasse. He is hunting bigger game \\xe2\\x80\\x94 the unified field theory. String the- \\nory, we recall, began as a quantum theory and then later absorbed Ein- \\nstein\\'s theory of gravity. Hawking, starting as a pure classical relativist \\nrather than a quantum theorist, approaches the problem from the other \\npoint of view. He and his colleague James Hartle start with Einstein\\'s \\nclassical universe, and then quantize the entire universe! \\n\\n\\nWave Function of the Universe \\n\\nHawking is one of the founders of a new scientific discipline, called \\nquantum cosmology. At first, this seems like a contradiction in terms. The \\nword quantum applies to the infinitesimally small world of quarks and \\nneutrinos, while cosmology signifies the almost limitless expanse of outer \\nspace. However, Hawking and others now believe that the ultimate ques- \\ntions of cosmology can be answered only by quantum theory. Hawking \\ntakes quantum cosmology to its ultimate quantum conclusion, allowing \\nthe existence of infinite numbers of parallel universes. \\n\\nThe starting point of quantum theory, we recall, is a wave function \\nthat describes all the various possible states of a particle. For example, \\nimagine a large, irregular thundercloud that fills up the sky. The darker \\nthe thundercloud, the greater the concentration of water vapor and dust \\nat that point. Thus by simply looking at a thundercloud, we can rapidly \\nestimate the probability of finding large concentrations of water and \\ndust in certain parts of the sky. \\n\\nThe thundercloud may be compared to a single electron\\'s wave func- \\ntion. Like a thundercloud, it fills up all space. Likewise, the greater its \\nvalue at a point, the greater the probability of finding the electron there. \\nSimilarly, wave functions can be associated with large objects, like peo- \\n\\n\\n\\n254 WORMHOLES: GATEWAYS TO ANOTHER UNIVERSE? \\n\\npie. As I sit in my chair in Princeton, I know that I have a Schodinger \\nprobability wave function. If I could somehow see my own wave function, \\nit would resemble a cloud very much in the shape of my body. However, \\nsome of the cloud would spread out over all space, out to Mars and even \\nbeyond the solar system, although it would be vanishingly small there. \\nThis means that there is very large likelihood that I am, in fact, sitting \\nin my chair and not on the planet Mars. Although part of my wave func- \\ntion has spread even beyond the Milky Way galaxy, there is only an infin- \\nitesimal chance that I am sitting in another galaxy. \\n\\nHawking\\'s new idea was to treat the entire universe as though it were \\na quantum particle. By repeating some simple steps, we are led to some \\neye-opening conclusions. \\n\\nWe begin with a wave function describing the set of all possible uni- \\nverses. This means that the starting point of Hawking\\'s theory must be \\nan infinite set of parallel universes, the wave function of the universe. Hawk- \\ning\\'s rather simple analysis, replacing the word particle with universe, has \\nled to a conceptual revolution in our thinking about cosmology. \\n\\nAccording to this picture, the wave function of the universe spreads \\nout over all possible universes. The wave function is assumed to be quite \\nlarge near our own universe, so there is a good chance that our universe \\nis the correct one, as we expect. However, the wave function spreads out \\nover all other universes, even those that are lifeless and incompatible \\nwith the familiar laws of physics. Since the wave function is supposedly \\nvanishingly small for these other universes, we do not expect that our \\nuniverse will make a quantum leap to them in the near future. \\n\\nThe goal facing quantum cosmologists is to verify this conjecture \\nmathematically, to show that the wave function of the universe is large \\nfor our present universe and vanishingly small for other universes. This \\nwould then prove that our familiar universe is in some sense unique and \\nalso stable. (At present, quantum cosmologists are unable to solve this \\nimportant problem.) \\n\\nIf we take Hawking seriously, it means that we must begin our analysis \\nwith an infinite number of all possible universes, coexisting with one \\nanother. To put it bluntly, the definition of the word universes no longer \\n\"all that exists.\" It now means \"all that can exist.\" For example, in \\nFigure 12.1 we see how the wave function of the universe can spread out \\nover several possible universes, with our universe being the most likely \\none but certainly not the only one. Hawking\\'s quantum cosmology also \\nassumes that the wave function of the universe allows these universes to \\ncollide. Wormholes can develop and link these universes. However, \\nthese wormholes are not like the ones we encountered in the previous \\n\\n\\n\\nColliding Universes \\n\\n\\n255 \\n\\n\\n\\nOur Other \\n\\nuniverse universes \\n\\n\\nFigure 12.1. In Hawking\\'s wave function of the universe, the wave function is \\nmost likely concentrated around own universe. We live in our universe because it \\nis the most likely, with the largest probability. However, there is a small but non- \\nvanishing probability that the wave function prefers neighboring, parallel uni- \\nverses. Thus transitions between universes may be possible (although with very \\nlow probability). \\n\\n\\nchapters, which connect different parts of three-dimensional space with \\nitself \\xe2\\x80\\x94 these wormholes connect different universes with one another. \\n\\nThink, for example, of a large collection of soap bubbles, suspended \\nin air. Normally, each soap bubble is like a universe unto itself, except \\nthat periodically it bumps into another bubble, forming a larger one, or \\nsplits into two smaller bubbles. The difference is that each soap bubble \\nis now an entire ten-dimensional universe. Since space and time can exist \\nonly on each bubble, there is no such thing as space and time between \\nthe bubbles. Each universe has its own self-contained \"time.\" It is mean- \\ningless to say that time passes at the same rate in all these universes. (We \\nshould, however, stress that travel between these universes is not open \\nto us because of our primitive technological level. Furthermore, \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 12.2. Our universe may be one of an infinite number of parallel universes, \\neach connected to the others by an infinite series of wormholes. Travel between \\nthese wormholes is possible but extremely unlikely. \\n\\n\\n256 \\n\\n\\nColliding Universes \\n\\n\\n257 \\n\\n\\nwe should also stress that large quantum transitions on this scale are \\nextremely rare, probably much larger than the lifetime of our universe.) \\nMost of these universes are dead universes, devoid of any life. On these \\nuniverses, the laws of physics were different, and hence the physical con- \\nditions that made life possible were not satisfied. Perhaps, among the \\nbillions of parallel universes, only one (ours) had the right set of physical \\nlaws to allow life (Figure 12.2). \\n\\nHawking\\'s \"baby universe\" theory, although not a practical method \\nof transportation, certainly raises philosophical and perhaps even relig- \\nions questions. Already, it has stimulated two long-simmering debates \\namong cosmologists. \\n\\n\\nPutting God Back in the Universe? \\n\\nThe first debate concerns the anthropic principle. Over the centuries, sci- \\nentists have learned to view the universe largely independent of human \\nbias. We no longer project our human prejudices and whims onto every \\nscientific discovery. Historically, however, early scientists often commit- \\nted the fallacy of anthropomorphism, which assumes that objects and \\nanimals have humanlike qualities. This error is committed by anyone \\nwho sees human emotions and feelings being exhibited by their pets. (It \\nis also committed by Hollywood scriptwriters who regularly assume that \\nbeings similar to us must populate planets orbiting the stars in the heav- \\nens.) \\n\\nAnthropomorphism is an age-old problem. The Ionian philosopher \\nXenophanes once lamented, \"Men imagine gods to be born, and to \\nhave clothes and voices and shapes like theirs. . . . Yea, the gods of the \\nEthiopians are black and flat-nosed, and the gods of the Thracians are \\nred-haired and blue-eyed.\" Within the past few decades, some cosmol- \\nogists have been horrified to find anthropomorphism creeping back into \\nscience, under the guise of the anthropic principle, some ofwhose advo- \\ncates openly declare that they would like to put God back into science. \\n\\nActually, there is some scientific merit to this strange debate over the \\nanthropic principle, which revolves around the indisputable fact that if \\nthe physical constants of the universe were altered by the smallest \\namount, life in the universe would be impossible. Is this remarkable fact \\njust a fortunate coincidence, or does it show the work of some Supreme \\nBeing? \\n\\nThere are two versions of the anthropic principle. The \"weak\" ver- \\nsion states that the fact that intelligent life (us) exists in the universe \\n\\n\\n\\n258 \\n\\n\\nWORMHOLES: GATEWAYS TO ANOTHER UNIVERSE? \\n\\n\\nshould be taken as an experimental fact that helps us understand the \\nconstants of the universe. As Nobel laureate Steven Weinberg explains \\nit, \"the world is the way it is, at least in part, because otherwise there \\nwould be no one to ask why it is the way it is.\" 1 Stated in this way, the \\nweak version of the anthropic principle is hard to argue with. \\n\\nTo have life in the universe, you need a rare conjunction of many \\ncoincidences. Life, which depends on a variety of complex biochemical \\nreactions, can easily be rendered impossible if we change some of the \\nconstants of chemistry and physics by a small amount. For example, if \\nthe constants that govern nuclear physics were changed even slightly, \\nthen nucleosynthesis and the creation of the heavy elements in the stars \\nand supernovae might become impossible. Then atoms might become \\nunstable or impossible to create in supernovae. Life depends on the \\nheavy elements (elements beyond iron) for the creation of DNA and \\nprotein molecules. Thus the smallest change in nuclear physics would \\nmake the heavy elements of the universe impossible to manufacture in \\nthe stars. We are children of the stars; however, if the laws of nuclear \\nphysics change in the slightest, then our \"parents\" are incapable of \\nhaving \"children\" (us). As another example, it is safe to say that the \\ncreation of life in the early oceans probably took 1 to 2 billion years. \\nHowever, if we could somehow shrink the lifetime of the proton to sev- \\neral million years, then life would be impossible. There would not be \\nenough time to create life out of random collisions of molecules. \\n\\nIn other words, the very fact that we exist in the universe to ask these \\nquestions about it means that a complex sequence of events must nec- \\nessarily have happened. It means that the physical constants of nature \\nmust have a certain range of values, so that the stars lived long enough \\nto create the heavy elements in our bodies, so that protons don\\'t decay \\ntoo rapidly before life has a chance to germinate, and so on. In other \\nwords, the existence of humans who can ask questions about the universe \\nplaces a huge number of rigid constraints on the physics of the uni- \\nverse \\xe2\\x80\\x94 for example, its age, its chemical composition, its temperature, \\nits size, and its physical processes. \\n\\nRemarking on these cosmic coincidences, physicist Freeman Dyson \\nonce wrote, \"As we look out into the Universe and identify the many \\naccidents of physics and astronomy that have worked together to our \\nbenefit, it almost seems as if the Universe must in some sense have known \\nthat we were coming.\" This takes us to the \"strong\" version of the \\nanthropic principle, which states that all the physical constants of the \\nuniverse have been precisely chosen (by God or some Supreme Being) \\nso that life is possible in our universe. The strong version, because it \\n\\n\\n\\nColliding Universes \\n\\n\\n259 \\n\\n\\nraises questions about a deity, is much more controversial among sci- \\nentists. \\n\\nConceivably, it might have been blind luck if only a few constants of \\nnature were required to assume certain values to make life possible. \\nHowever, it appears that a large set of physical constants must assume a \\nnarrow band of values in order for life to form in our universe. Since \\naccidents of this type are highly improbable, perhaps a divine intelli- \\ngence (God) precisely chose those values in order to create life. \\n\\nWhen scientists first hear of some version of the anthropic principle, \\nthey are immediately taken aback. Physicist Heinz Pagels recalled, \"Here \\nwas a form of reasoning completely foreign to the usual way that theo- \\nretical physicists went about their business .\" 1 \\n\\nThe anthropic argument is a more sophisticated version of the old \\nargument that God located the earth atjust the right distance from the \\nsun. If God had placed the earth too close, then it would be too hot to \\nsupport life. If God had placed the earth too far, then it would be too \\ncold. The fallacy of this argument is that millions of planets in the galaxy \\nprobably are sitting at the incorrect distance from their sun, and there- \\nfore life on them is impossible. However, some planets will, by pure \\naccident, be at the right distance from their sun. Our planet is one of \\nthem, and hence we are here to discuss the question. \\n\\nEventually, most scientists become disillusioned with the anthropic \\nprinciple because it has no predictive power, nor can it be tested. Pagels \\nreluctantly concluded that \"unlike the principles of physics, it affords \\nno way to determine whether it is right or wrong; there is no way to test \\nit. Unlike conventional physical principles, the anthropic principle is not \\nsubject to experimental falsification \\xe2\\x80\\x94 the sure sign that it is not a sci- \\nentific principle.\"\\' Physicist Alan Guth says bluntly, \"Emotionally, the \\nanthropic principle kind of rubs me the wrong way. . . . The anthropic \\nprinciple is something that people do if they can\\'t think of anything \\nbetter to do. \\n\\nTo Richard Feynman, the goal of a theoretical physicist is to \"prove \\nyourself wrong as fast as possible .\" 5 However, the anthropic principle is \\nsterile and cannot be disproved. Or, as Weinberg said, \"although science \\nis clearly impossible without scientists, it is not clear that the universe is \\nimpossible without science.\\'\" \\n\\nThe debate over the anthropic principle (and hence, about God) \\nwas dormant for many years, until it was recently revived by Hawking\\'s \\nwave function of the universe. If Hawking is correct, then indeed there \\nare an infinite number of parallel universes, many with different physical \\nconstants. In some of them, perhaps protons decay too rapidly, or stars \\n\\n\\n\\n260 \\n\\n\\nWORMHOLES: GATEWAYS TO ANOTHER UNIVERSE? \\n\\n\\ncannot manufacture the heavy elements beyond iron, or the Big Crunch \\ntakes place too rapidly before life can begin, and so on. In fact, an infi- \\nnite number of these parallel universes are dead, without the physical \\nlaws that can make life as we know it possible. \\n\\nOn one such parallel universe (ours), the laws of physics were com- \\npatible with life as we know it. The proof is that we are here today to \\ndiscuss the matter. If this is true, then perhaps God does not have to be \\nevoked to explain why life, precious as it is, is possible in our universe. \\nHowever, this reopens the possibility of the weak anthropic principle \\xe2\\x80\\x94 \\nthat is, that we coexist with many dead universes, and that ours is the \\nonly one compatible with life. \\n\\nThe second controversy stimulated by Hawking\\'s wave function of \\nthe universe is much deeper and in fact is still unresolved. It is called \\nthe Schrodinger\\'s cat problem. \\n\\n\\nSchrodinger\\'s Cat Revisited \\n\\nBecause Hawking\\xe2\\x80\\x99s theory of baby universes and wormholes uses the \\npower of quantum theory, it inevitably reopens the still unresolved \\ndebates concerning its foundations. Hawking\\'s wave function of the uni- \\nverse does not completely solve these paradoxes of quantum theory; it \\nonly expresses them in a startling new light. \\n\\nQuantum theory, we recall, states that for every object there is a wave \\nfunction that measures the probability of finding that object at a certain \\npoint in space and time. Quantum theory also states that you never really \\nknow the state of a particle until you have made an observation. Before \\na measurement is made, the particle can be in one of a variety of states, \\ndescribed by the Schrodinger wave function. Thus before an observation \\nor measurement can be made, you can\\'t really know the state of the \\nparticle. In fact, the particle exists in a nether state, a sum of all possible \\nstates, until a measurement is made. \\n\\nWhen this idea was first proposed by Niels Bohr and Werner Heisen- \\nberg, Einstein revolted against this concept. \"Does the moon existjust \\nbecause a mouse looks at it?\" he was fond of asking. According to the \\nstrict interpretation of quantum theory, the moon, before it is observed, \\ndoesn\\'t really exist as we know it. The moon can be, in fact, in any one \\nof an infinite number of states, including the state of being in the sky, \\nof being blown up, or of not being there at all. It is the measurement \\nprocess of looking at it that decides that the moon is actually circling \\nthe earth. \\n\\n\\n\\nColliding Universes \\n\\n\\n261 \\n\\n\\nEinstein had many heated discussions with Niels Bohr challenging \\nthis unorthodox world view. (In one exchange, Bohr said to Einstein in \\nexasperation, \"You are not thinking. You are merely being logical!\"\\xe2\\x80\\x99) \\nEven Erwin Schrodinger (who initiated the whole discussion with his \\ncelebrated wave equation) protested this reinterpretation of his equa- \\ntion. He once lamented, \"I don\\'t like it, and I\\'m sorry I ever had any- \\nthing to do with it.\"\\xe2\\x80\\x99 \\n\\nTo challenge this revisionist interpretation, the critics asked, \"Is a \\ncat dead or alive before you look at it?\" \\n\\nTo show how absurd this question is, Schroodinger placed an imag- \\ninary cat in a sealed box. The cat faces a gun, which is connected to a \\nGeiger counter, which in turn is connected to a piece of uranium. The \\nuranium atom is unstable and will undergo radioactive decay. If a ura- \\nnium nucleus disintegrates, it will be picked up by the Geiger counter, \\nwhich will then trigger the gun, whose bullet will kill the cat. \\n\\nTo decide whether the cat is dead or alive, we must open the box \\nand observe the cat. However, what is the state of the cat before we open \\nthe box? According to quantum theory, we can only state that the cat is \\ndescribed by a wave function that describes the sum of a dead cat and a \\nlive cat. \\n\\nTo Schrodinger, the idea of thinking about cats that are neither dead \\nnor alive was the height of absurdity, yet nevertheless the experimental \\nconfirmation of quantum mechanics forces us to this conclusion. At \\npresent, every experiment has verified quantum theory. \\n\\nThe paradox of Schrodinger\\'s cat is so bizarre that one is often \\nreminded of how Alice reacted to the vanishing of the Cheshire cat in \\nLewis Carroll\\'s fable: \" \\'You\\'ll see me there,\\' said the Cat, and vanished. \\nAlice was not much surprised at this, she was getting so well used to \\nqueer things happening.\" Over the years, physicists, too, have gotten \\nused to \"queer\" things happening in quantum mechanics. \\n\\nThere are at least three major ways that physicists deal with this com- \\nplexity. First, we can assume that God exists. Because all \"observations\" \\nimply an observer, then there must be some \"consciousness\" in the \\nuniverse. Some physicists, like Nobel laureate Eugene Wigner, have \\ninsisted that quantum theory proves the existence of some sort of uni- \\nversal cosmic consciousness in the universe. \\n\\nThe second way of dealing with the paradox is favored by the vast \\nmajority of working physicists \\xe2\\x80\\x94 to ignore the problem. Most physicists, \\npointing out that a camera without any consciousness can also make \\nmeasurements, simply wish that this sticky, but unavoidable, problem \\nwould go away. \\n\\n\\n\\n262 WORMHOLES: GATEWAYS TO ANOTHER UNIVERSE? \\n\\nThe physicist Richard Feynman once said, \"I think it is safe to say \\nthat no one understands quantum mechanics. Do not keep saying to \\nyourself, ifyou can possibly avoid it, \\'But how can it be like that?\\' because \\nyou will go \\'down the drain\\' into a blind alley from which nobody has \\nyet escaped. Nobody knows how it can be like that.\"\" In fact, it is often \\nstated that of all the theories proposed in this century, the silliest is \\nquantum theory. Some say that the only thing that quantum theory has \\ngoing for it, in fact, is that it is unquestionably correct. \\n\\nHowever, there is a third way of dealing with this paradox, called the \\nmany-worlds theory. This theory (like the anthropic principle) fell out of \\nfavor in the past decades, but is being revived again by Hawking\\'s wave \\nfunction of the universe. \\n\\n\\nMany Worlds \\n\\nIn 1957, physicist Hugh Everett raised the possibility that during the \\nevolution of the universe, it continually \"split\" in half, like a fork in a \\nroad. In one universe, the uranium atom did not disintegrate and the \\ncat was not shot. In the other, the uranium atom did disintegrate and \\nthe cat was shot. If Everett is correct, there are an infinite number of \\nuniverses. Each universe is linked to every other through the network of \\nforks in the road. Or, as the Argentinian writerjorge Luis Borges wrote \\nin The Garden of Forking Paths, \"time forks perpetually toward innumer- \\nable futures.\" \\n\\nPhysicist Bryce DeWitt, one of the proponents of the many-worlds \\ntheory, describes the lasting impact it made on him: \"Every quantum \\ntransition taking place on every star, in every galaxy, in every remote \\ncorner of the universe is splitting our local world on earth into myriads \\nof copies of itself. I still recall vividly the shock I experienced on first \\nencountering this multiworld concept.\"\" The many-worlds theory pos- \\ntulates that all possible quantum worlds exist. In some worlds, humans \\nexist as the dominant life form on earth. In other worlds, subatomic \\nevents took place that prevented humans from ever evolving on this \\nplanet. \\n\\nAs physicist Frank Wilczek noted, \\n\\n\\nIt is said that the history of the world would be entirely different if Helen \\nof Troy had had a wart at the tip of her nose. Well, warts can arise from \\nmutations in single cells, often triggered by exposure to the ultraviolet rays \\n\\n\\n\\nColliding Universes \\n\\n\\n263 \\n\\n\\nof the sun. Conclusion: there are many, many worlds in which Helen of \\n\\nTroy did have a wart at the tip of her nose.\" \\n\\nActually, the idea that there may be multiple universes is an old one. \\nThe philosopher St. Albertus Magnus once wrote, \"Do there exist many \\nworlds, or is there but a single world? This is one of the most noble and \\nexalted questions in the study of Nature.\" However, the new twist on \\nthis ancient idea is that these many worlds resolve the Schrodinger cat \\nparadox. In one universe, the cat may be dead; in another, the cat is \\nalive. \\n\\nAs strange as Everett\\'s many-worlds theory seems, one can show that \\nit is mathematically equivalent to the usual interpretations of quantum \\ntheory. But traditionally, Everett\\'s many-worlds theory has not been pop- \\nular among physicists. Although it cannot be ruled out, the idea of an \\ninfinite number of equally valid universes, each fissioning in half at every \\ninstant in time, poses a philosophical nightmare for physicists, who love \\nsimplicity. There is a principle of physics called Occam\\'s razor, which \\nstates that we should always take the simplest possible path and ignore \\nmore clumsy alternatives, especially if the alternatives can never be mea- \\nsured. (Thus Occam\\'s razor dismisses the old \"aether\" theory, which \\nstated that a mysterious gas once pervaded the entire universe. The \\naether theory provided a convenient answer to an embarrassing ques- \\ntion: If light is a wave, and light can travel in a vacuum, then what is \\nwaving? The answer was that aether, like a fluid, was vibrating even in a \\nvacuum. Einstein showed that the aether was unnecessary. However, he \\nnever said that the aether didn\\'t exist. He merely said it was irrelevant. \\nThus by Occam\\'s razor, physicists don\\'t refer to the aether anymore.) \\n\\nOne can show that communication between Everett\\'s many worlds \\nis not possible. Therefore, each universe is unaware of the existence of \\nthe others. If experiments cannot test for the existence of these worlds, \\nwe should, by Occam\\'s razor, eliminate them. \\n\\nSomewhat in the same vein, physicists do not say categorically that \\nangels and miracles cannot exist. Perhaps they do. But miracles, almost \\nby definition, are not repeatable and therefore not measurable by exper- \\niment. Therefore, by Occam\\'s razor, we must dismiss them (unless, of \\ncourse, we can find a reproducible, measurable miracle or angel). One \\nof the developers of the many-worlds theory, Everett\\'s mentor John \\nWheeler, reluctantly rejected it because \"it required too much meta- \\nphysical baggage to carry around.\" 1 \\' \\n\\nThe unpopularity of the many-worlds theory, however, may subside \\nas Hawking\\'s wave function of the universe gains popularity. Everett\\'s \\n\\n\\n\\n264 \\n\\n\\nWORMHOLES: GATEWAYS TO ANOTHER UNIVERSE? \\n\\n\\ntheory was based on single particles, with no possibility of communica- \\ntion between different universes as they fissioned. However, Hawking\\'s \\ntheory, although related, goes much further: It is based on an infinite \\nnumber of self-contained universes (and notjust particles) and postu- \\nlates the possibility of tunneling (via wormholes) between them. \\n\\nHawking has even undertaken the daunting task of calculating the \\nsolution to the wave function of the universe. He is confident that his \\napproach is correct partly because the theory is well defined (if. as we \\nmentioned, the theory is ultimately defined in ten dimensions). His goal \\nis to show that the wave function of the universe assumes a large value \\nnear a universe that looks like ours. Thus our universe is the most likely \\nuniverse, but certainly not the only one. \\n\\nBy now, there have been a number of international conferences on \\nthe wave function of the universe. However, as before, the mathematics \\ninvolved in the wave function of the universe is beyond the calculational \\nability of any human on this planet, and we may have to wait years before \\nany enterprising individual can find a rigorous solution to Hawking\\'s \\nequations. \\n\\n\\nParallel Worlds \\n\\nA major difference between Everett\\'s many-worlds theory and Hawking\\'s \\nwave function of the universe is that Hawking\\'s theory places wormholes \\nthat connect these parallel universes at the center of his theory. How- \\never, there is no need to wonder whether you will someday walk home \\nfrom work, open the door, enter a parallel universe, and discover that \\nyour family never heard of you. Instead of rushing to meet you after a \\nhard day\\'s work, your family is thrown into a panic, scream about an \\nintruder, and have you thrown in jail for illegal entry. This kind of sce- \\nnario happens only on television or in the movies. In Hawking\\'s \\napproach, the wormholes do, in fact, constantly connect our universe \\nwith billions upon billions of parallel universes, but the size of these \\nwormholes, on the average, is extremely small, about the size of the \\nPlanck length (about a 100 billion billion times smaller than a proton, \\ntoo small for human travel). Furthermore, since large quantum transi- \\ntions between these universes are infrequent, we may have to wait a long \\ntime, longer than the lifetime of the universe, before such an event takes \\nplace. \\n\\nThus it is perfectly consistent with the laws of physics (although highly \\nunlikely) that someone may enter a twin universe that is precisely like \\n\\n\\n\\nColliding Universes \\n\\n\\n265 \\n\\n\\nour universe except for one small crucial difference, created at some \\npoint in time when the two universes split apart. \\n\\nThis type of parallel world was explored by John Wyndham in the \\nstory \"Random Quest.\" Colin Trafford, a British nuclear physicist, is \\nalmost killed in 1954 when a nuclear experiment blows up. Instead of \\nwinding up in the hospital, he wakes up, alone and unhurt, in a remote \\npart of London. He is relieved that everything appears normal, but soon \\ndiscovers that something is very wrong. The newspaper headlines are all \\nimpossible. World War II never took place. The atomic bomb was never \\ndiscovered. \\n\\nWorld history has been twisted. Furthermore, he glances at a store \\nshelf and notices his own name, with his picture, as the author of a best- \\nselling book. He is shocked. An exact counterpart of himself exists in \\nthis parallel world as an author instead of a nuclear physicist! \\n\\nIs he dreaming all this? Years ago. he once thought of becoming a \\nwriter, but instead he chose to become a nuclear physicist. Apparently \\nin this parallel universe, different choices were made in the past. \\n\\nTrafford scans the London telephone book and finds his name listed, \\nbut the address is wrong. Shaking, he decides to visit \"his\" home. \\n\\nEntering \"his\" apartment, he is shocked to meet \"his\" wife \\xe2\\x80\\x94 some- \\none he has never seen before \\xe2\\x80\\x94 a beautiful woman who is bitter and \\nangry over \"his\" numerous affairs with other women. She berates \"him\" \\nfor his extramarital indiscretions, but she notices that her husband \\nseems confused. His counterpart, Trafford finds out, is a cad and a wom- \\nanizer. However, he finds it difficult to argue with a beautiful stranger \\nhe has never seen before, even if she happens to be \"his\" wife. Appar- \\nently, he and his counterpart have switched universes. \\n\\nHe gradually finds himself falling in love with \"his\" own wife. He \\ncannot understand how his counterpart could ever have treated his \\nlovely wife in such a despicable manner. The next few weeks spent \\ntogether are the best of their lives. He decides to undo all the harm his \\ncounterpart inflicted on his wife over the years. Then, just as the two are \\nrediscovering each other, he is suddenly wrenched back into his own \\nuniverse, leaving \"his\" love behind. Thrown back into his own universe \\nagainst his will, he begins a frantic quest to find \"his\" wife. He has \\ndiscovered that most, but not all, people in his universe have a counter- \\npart in the other. Surely, he reasons, \"his\" wife must have a counterpart \\nin his own world. \\n\\nHe becomes obsessed, tracking down all the clues that he remembers \\nfrom the twin universe. Using all his knowledge of history and physics, \\nhe concludes that two worlds diverged from each other because of some \\n\\n\\n\\n266 \\n\\n\\nWORMHOLES: GATEWAYS TO ANOTHER UNIVERSE? \\n\\n\\npivotal event in 1926 or 1927. A single event, he reasons, must have split \\nthe two universes apart. \\n\\nHe then meticulously traces the birth and death records of several \\nfamilies. He spends his remaining savings interviewing scores of people \\nuntil he locates \"his\" wife\\'s family tree. Eventually, he succeeds in track- \\ning down \"his\" wife in his own universe. In the end, he marries her. \\n\\n\\nAttack of the Giant Wormholes \\n\\nOne Harvard physicist who hasjumped into the fray concerning worm- \\nholes is Sidney Coleman. Resembling a cross between Woody Allen and \\nAlbert Einstein, he shuffles through the corridors of Jefferson Hall, try- \\ning to convince the skeptics of his latest theory of wormholes. With his \\nChaplinesque moustache, his hair swept back like Einstein\\'s, and his \\noversize sweatshirt, Coleman stands out in any crowd. Now he claims to \\nhave solved the celebrated cosmological constant problem, which has \\npuzzled physicists for the past 80 years. \\n\\nHis work even made the cover of Discover Magazine, with an article \\nentitled \"Parallel Universes: The New Reality \\xe2\\x80\\x94 From Harvard\\'s Wildest \\nPhysicist.\" He is also wild about science fiction; a serious science-fiction \\nfan, he even co-founded Advent Publishers, which published books on \\nscience-fiction criticism. \\n\\nAt present, Coleman vigorously engages the critics who say that sci- \\nentists won\\'t be able to verify wormhole theories within our lifetime. If \\nwe believe in Thome\\'s wormholes, then we have to wait until someone \\ndiscovers exotic matter or masters the Casimir effect. Until then, our \\ntime machines have no \"engine\" capable of shooting us into the past. \\nSimilarly, if we believe in Hawking\\'s wormholes, then we have to travel \\nin \"imaginary time\" in order to travel between wormholes. Either way, \\nit a very sad state of affairs for the average theoretical physicist, who feels \\nfrustrated by the inadequate, feeble technology of the twentieth century \\nand who can only dream of harnessing the Planck energy. \\n\\nThis is where Coleman\\'s work comes in. He recently made the claim \\nthat the wormholes might yield a very tangible, very measurable result \\nin the present, and not in some distant, unforeseeable future. As we \\npointed out earlier, Einstein\\'s equations state that the matter-energy \\ncontent of an object determines the curvature of space-time surround- \\ning it. Einstein wondered whether the pure vacuum of empty space could \\ncontain energy. Is pure emptiness devoid of energy? This vacuum energy \\nis measured by something called the cosmological constant; in principle, \\n\\n\\n\\nColliding Universes \\n\\n\\n267 \\n\\n\\nthere is nothing to prevent a cosmological constant from appearing in \\nthe equations. Einstein thought this term was aesthetically ugly, but he \\ncould not rule it out on physical or mathematical grounds. \\n\\nIn the 1920s, when Einstein tried to solve his equations for the uni- \\nverse, he found, much to his chagrin, that the universe was expanding. \\nBack then, the prevailing wisdom was that the universe was static and \\nunchanging. In order to \"fudge\" his equations to prevent the expansion \\nof the universe, Einstein inserted a tiny cosmological constant into this \\nsolution, chosen so it wouldjust balance out the expansion, yielding a \\nstatic universe by fiat. In 1929, when Hubble conclusively proved that \\nthe universe is indeed expanding, Einstein banished the cosmological \\nconstant and said it was the \"greatest blunder of my life.\" \\n\\nToday, we know that the cosmological constant is very close to zero. \\nIf there were a small negative cosmological constant, then gravity would \\nbe powerfully attractive and the entire universe might be, say, just a few \\nfeet across. (By reaching out with your hand, you should be able to grab \\nthe person in front of you, who happens to be yourself.) If there were a \\nsmall positive cosmological constant, then gravity would be repulsive and \\neverything would be flying away from you so fast that their light would \\nnever reach you. Since neither nightmarish scenario occurs, we are con- \\nfident that the cosmological constant is extremely tiny or even zero. \\n\\nBut this problem resurfaced in the 1970s, when symmetry breaking \\nwas being intensively studied in the Standard Model and GUT theory. \\nWhenever a symmetry is broken, a large amount of energy is dumped \\ninto the vacuum. In fact, the amount of energy flooding the vacuum is \\n10 \\xe2\\x80\\x9d times larger than the experimentally observed amount. In all of \\nphysics, this discrepancy of 10 \\xe2\\x80\\x9d is unquestionably the largest. Nowhere \\nin physics do we see such a large divergence between theory (which \\npredicts a large vacuum energy whenever a symmetry is broken) and \\nexperiment (which measures zero cosmological constant in the uni- \\nverse). This is where Coleman\\'s wormholes comes in; they\\'re needed to \\ncancel the unwanted contributions to the cosmological constant. \\n\\nAccording to Hawking, there may be an infinite number of alterna- \\ntive universes coexisting with ours, all of which are connected by an \\ninfinite web of interlocking wormholes. Coleman tried to add up the \\ncontribution from this infinite series. After the sum was performed, he \\nfound a surprising result: The wave function of the universe prefers to \\nhave zero cosmological constant, as desired. If the cosmological constant \\nwas zero, the wave function became exceptionally large, meaning that \\nthere was a high probability of finding a universe with zero cosmological \\nconstant. Moreover, the wave function of the universe quickly vanished \\n\\n\\n\\n268 \\n\\n\\nWORMHOLES: GATEWAYS TO ANOTHER UNIVERSE? \\n\\n\\nif the cosmological constant became nonzero, meaning that there was \\nzero probability for that unwanted universe. This was exactly what was \\nneeded to cancel the cosmological constant. In other words, the cos- \\nmological constant was zero because that was the most probable out- \\ncome. The only effect of having billions upon billions of parallel uni- \\nverses was to keep the cosmological constant zero in our universe. \\n\\nBecause this was such an important result, physicists immediately \\nbegan to leap into the field. \"When Sidney came out with this work, \\neveryone j umped, \" recalls Stanford physicist Leonard Susskind.\" In his \\ntypical puckish way, Coleman published this potentially important result \\nwith a bit of humor. \"It is always possible that unknown to myself I am \\nup to my neck in quicksand and sinking fast,\" he wrote. 14 \\n\\nColeman likes to impress audiences vividly with the importance of \\nthis problem, that the chances of canceling out a cosmological constant \\nto one part in 10\\xe2\\x80\\x9c\\xc2\\xb0 is fantastically small. \"Imagine that over a ten-year \\nperiod you spend millions of dollars without looking at your salary, and \\nwhen you finally compare what you earn with what you spent, they bal- \\nance out to the penny,\" he notes. 1 Thus his calculation, which shows \\nthat you can cancel the cosmological constant to one part in 10\\'\"\", is a \\nhighly nontrivial result. To add frosting to the cake, Coleman empha- \\nsizes that these wormholes also solve another problem: They help to \\ndetermine the values of the fundamental constants of the universe. Cole- \\nman adds, \"It was a completely different mechanism from any that had \\nbeen considered. It was Batman swinging in on his rope.\" 1 \\' \\n\\nBut criticisms also began to surface; the most persistent criticism was \\nthat he assumed that the wormholes were small, on the order of the \\nPlanck length, and that he forgot to sum over large wormholes. Accord- \\ning to the critics, large wormholes should also be included in his sum. \\nBut since we don\\'t see large, visible wormholes anywhere, it seems that \\nhis calculation has a fatal flaw. \\n\\nUnfazed by this criticism, Coleman shot back in his usual way: choos- \\ning outrageous titles for his papers. To prove that large wormholes can \\nbe neglected in his calculation, he wrote a rebuttal to his critics with the \\ntitle \"Escape from the Menace of the Giant Wormholes.\" When asked \\nabout his titles, he replied, \"If Nobel Prizes were given for titles, I\\'d have \\nalready collected mine.\"\" \\n\\nIf Coleman\\'s purely mathematical arguments are correct, they would \\ngive hard experimental evidence that wormholes are an essential feature \\nof all physical processes, and notjust some pipe dream. It would mean \\nthat wormholes connecting our universe with an infinite number of dead \\nuniverses are essential to prevent our universe from wrapping itself up \\n\\n\\n\\nColliding Universes \\n\\n\\n269 \\n\\n\\ninto a tight, tiny ball, or from exploding outward at fantastic rates. It \\nwould mean that wormholes are the essential feature making our uni- \\nverse relatively stable. \\n\\nBut as with most developments that occur at the Planck length, the \\nfinal solution to these wormhole equations will have to wait until we \\nhave a better grasp of quantum gravity. Many of Coleman\\'s equations \\nrequire a means of eliminating the infinities common to all quantum \\ntheories of gravity, and this means using superstring theory. In particu- \\nlar, we may have to wait until we can confidently calculate finite quantum \\ncorrections to his theory. Many of these strange predictions will have to \\nwait until we can sharpen our calculational tools. \\n\\nAs we have emphasized, the problem is mainly theoretical. We simply \\ndo not have the mathematical brainpower to break open these well- \\ndefined problems. The equations stare at us from the blackboard, but \\nwe are helpless to find rigorous, finite solutions to them at present. Once \\nphysicists have a better grasp of the physics at the Planck energy, then \\na whole new universe of possibilities opens up. Anyone, or any civiliza- \\ntion, that truly masters the energy found at the Planck length will \\nbecome the master of all fundamental forces. That is the next topic to \\nwhich we will turn. When can we expect to become masters of hyper- \\nspace? \\n\\n\\n\\nPART IV \\n\\n\\nMasters of \\nHyperspace \\n\\n\\n\\n13 \\n\\nBeyond the Future \\n\\n\\nWhat does it mean for a civilization to be a million years old? \\nWe have had radio telescopes and spaceships for a few dec- \\nades; our technical civilization is a few hundred years old .. . \\nan advanced civilization millions of years old is as much \\nbeyond us as we are beyond a bush baby or a macaque. \\n\\nCarl Sagan \\n\\n\\nP HYSICIST Paul Davies once commented on what to expect once \\nwe have solved the mysteries of the unification of all forces into a \\nsingle superforce. He wrote that \\n\\n\\nwe could change the structure of space and time, tie our own knots in \\nnothingness, and build matter to order. Controlling the superforce would \\nenable us to construct and transmute particles at will, thus generating \\nexotic forms of matter. We might even be able to manipulate the dimen- \\nsionality of space itself, creating bizarre artificial worlds with unimaginable \\nproperties. Truly we should be lords of the universe.\\' \\n\\n\\nWhen can we expect to harness the power of hyperspace? Experi- \\nmental verification of the hyperspace theory, at least indirectly, may \\ncome in the twenty-first century. However, the energy scale necessary to \\nmanipulate (and not just verify) ten-dimensional space-time, to become \\n\"lords of the universe,\" is many centuries beyond today\\'s technology. \\nAs we have seen, enormous amounts of matter-energy are necessary to \\n\\n\\n273 \\n\\n\\n274 \\n\\n\\nMASTERS OF HYPERSPACE \\n\\n\\nperform near-miraculous feats, such as creating wormholes and altering \\nthe direction of time. \\n\\nTo be masters of the tenth dimension, either we encounter intelli- \\ngent life within the galaxy that has already harnessed these astronomical \\nenergy levels, or we struggle for several thousand years before we attain \\nthis ability ourselves. For example, our current atom smashers or particle \\naccelerators can boost the energy of a particle to over 1 trillion electron \\nvolts (the energy created if an electron were accelerated by 1 trillion \\nvolts). The largest accelerator is currently located in Geneva, Switzer- \\nland, and operated by a consortium of 14 European nations. But this \\nenergy pales before the energy necessary to probe hyperspace: 10 \" bil- \\nlion electron volts, or a quadrillion times larger than the energy that \\nmight have been produced by the SSC. \\n\\nA quadrillion (1 with 15 zeros after it) may seem like an impossibly \\nlarge number. The technology necessary to probe this incredible energy \\nmay require atom smashers billions of miles long, or an entirely new \\ntechnology altogether. Even if we were to liquidate the entire gross \\nnational product of the world and build a super-powerful atom smasher, \\nwe would not be able to come close to this energy. At first, it seems an \\nimpossible task to harness this level of energy. \\n\\nHowever, this number does not seem so ridiculously large if we \\nunderstand that technology expands exponentially, which is difficult for \\nour minds to comprehend. To understand how fast exponential \\ngrowth is, imagine a bacterium that splits in half every 30 minutes. If its \\ngrowth is unimpeded, then within a few weeks this single bacterium \\nwill produce a colony that will weigh as much as the entire planet \\nearth. \\n\\nAlthough humans have existed on this planet for perhaps 2 million \\nyears, the rapid climb to modern civilization within the last 200 years \\nwas possible due to the fact that the growth of scientific knowledge is \\nexponential; that is, its rate of expansion is proportional to how much \\nis already known. The more we know, the faster we can know more. For \\nexample, we have amassed more knowledge since World War II than all \\nthe knowledge amassed in our 2-million-year evolution on this planet. \\nIn fact, the amount ofknowledge that our scientists gain doubles approx- \\nimately every 10 to 20 years. \\n\\nThus it becomes important to analyze our own development histor- \\nically. To appreciate how technology can grow exponentially, let us ana- \\nlyze our own evolution, focusing strictly on the energy available to the \\naverage human. This will help put the energy necessary to exploit the \\nten-dimensional theory into proper historical perspective. \\n\\n\\n\\nBeyond the Future \\n\\n\\n275 \\n\\n\\nThe Exponential Rise of Civilization \\n\\nToday, we may think nothing about taking a Sunday drive in the country \\nin a car with a 200-horsepower engine. But the energy available to the \\naverage human during most of our evolution on this planet was consid- \\nerably less. \\n\\nDuring this period, the basic energy source was the power of our own \\nhands, about one-eighth of a horsepower. Humans roamed the earth in \\nsmall bands, hunting and foraging for food in packs much like animals, \\nusing only the energy of their own muscles. From an energy point of \\nview, this changed only within the last 100,000 years. With the invention \\nof hand tools, humans could extend the power of their limbs. Spears \\nextended the power of their arms, clubs the power of their fists, and \\nknives the power of theirjaws. In this period, their energy output dou- \\nbled, to about one-quarter of a horsepower. \\n\\nWithin the past 10,000 or so years, the energy output of a human \\ndoubled once again. The main reason for this change was probably the \\nend of the Ice Age, which had retarded human development for \\nthousands of years. \\n\\nHuman society, which consisted of small bands of hunters and gath- \\nerers for hundreds of thousands of years, changed with the discovery of \\nagriculture soon after the ice melted. Roving bands of humans, not hav- \\ning to follow game across the plains and forests, settled in stable villages \\nwhere crops could be harvested around the year. Also, with the melting \\nof the ice sheet came the domestication of animals such as horses and \\noxen; the energy available to a human rose to approximately 1 horse- \\npower. \\n\\nWith the beginning of a stratified, agrarian life came the division of \\nlabor, until society underwent an important change: the transition to a \\nslave society. This meant that one person, the slave owner, could com- \\nmand the energy of hundreds of slaves. This sudden increase in energy \\nmade possible inhuman brutality; it also made possible the first true \\ncities, where kings could command their slaves to use large cranes, lev- \\ners, and pulleys to erect fortresses and monuments to themselves. \\nBecause of this increase in energy, out of the deserts and forests rose \\ntemples, towers, pyramids, and cities. \\n\\nFrom an energy point of view, for about 99.99% of the existence of \\nhumanity on this planet, the technological level of our species was only \\none step above that of animals. It has only been within the past few \\nhundred years that humans have had more than 1 horsepower available \\nto them. \\n\\n\\n\\n276 \\n\\n\\nMASTERS OF HYPERSPACE \\n\\n\\nA decisive change came with the Industrial Revolution. Newton\\'s dis- \\ncovery of the universal law of gravity and motion made it possible to \\nreduce mechanics to a set of well-defined equations. Thus Newton\\'s clas- \\nsical theory of the gravitational force, in some sense, paved the way for \\nthe modern theory of machines. This helped to make possible the wide- \\nspread use of steam-powered engines in the nineteenth century; with \\nsteam, the average human could command tens to hundreds of horse- \\npowers. For example, the railroads opened up entire continents to devel- \\nopment, and steamships opened up modern international trade. Both \\nwere energized by the power of steam, heated by coal. \\n\\nIt took over 10,000 years for humanity to create modern civilization \\nover the face of Europe. With steam-driven and later oil-fired machines, \\nthe United States was industrialized within a century. Thus the mastery \\nof just a single fundamental force of nature vastly increased the energy \\navailable to a human being and irrevocably changed society. \\n\\nBy the late nineteenth century. Maxwell\\'s mastery of the electromag- \\nnetic force once again set off a revolution in energy. The electromag- \\nnetic force made possible the electrification of our cities and our homes, \\nexponentially increasing the versatility and power of our machines. \\nSteam engines were now being replaced by powerful dynamos. \\n\\nWithin the past 50 years, the discovery of the nuclear force has \\nincreased the power available to a single human by a factor of a million. \\nBecause the energy of chemical reactions is measured in electron volts, \\nwhile the energy of fission and fusion is measured in millions of electron \\nvolts, we have a millionfold increase in the power available to us. \\n\\nThe lesson from analyzing the historical energy needs of humanity \\nshows graphically how for only 0.01% of our existence we have manip- \\nulated energy levels beyond that of animals. Yet within just a few cen- \\nturies, we have unleashed vast amounts of energy via the electromagnetic \\nand nuclear forces. Let us now leave the past and begin a discussion of \\nthe future, using the same methodology, to understand the point at \\nwhich we may harness the superforce. \\n\\n\\nType I, II, and III Civilizations \\n\\nFuturology, or the prediction of the future from reasonable scientific \\njudgments, is a risky science. Some would not even call it a science at \\nall, but something that more resembles hocus pocus or witchcraft. Futu- \\nrology has deservedly earned this unsavory reputation because every \\n\"scientific\" poll conducted by futurologists about the next decade has \\n\\n\\n\\nBeyond the Future \\n\\n\\n277 \\n\\n\\nproved to be wildly off the mark. What makes futurology such a primitive \\nscience is that our brains think linearly, while knowledge progresses \\nexponentially. For example, polls of futurologists have shown that they \\ntake known technology and simply double or triple it to predict the \\nfuture. Polls taken in the 1920s showed that futurologists predicted that \\nwe would have, within a few decades, huge fleets of blimps taking pas- \\nsengers across the Atlantic. \\n\\nBut science also develops in unexpected ways. In the short run, when \\nextrapolating within a few years, it is a safe bet that science will progress \\nthrough steady, quantitative improvements on existing technology. How- \\never, when extrapolating over a few decades, we find that qualitative \\nbreakthroughs in new areas become the dominant factor, where new \\nindustries open up in unexpected places. \\n\\nPerhaps the most famous example of futurology gone wrong is the \\npredictions made by John von Neumann, the father of the modern elec- \\ntronic computer and one of the great mathematicians of the century. \\nAfter the war, he made two predictions: first, that in the future comput- \\ners would become so monstrous and costly that only large governments \\nwould be able to afford them, and second, that computers would be able \\nto predict the weather accurately. \\n\\nIn reality, the growth of computers went in precisely the opposite \\ndirection: We are flooded with inexpensive, miniature computers that \\ncan fit in the palm of our hands. Computer chips have become so cheap \\nand plentiful that they are an integral part of some modern appliances. \\nAlready, we have the \"smart\" typewriter (the word processor), and even- \\ntually we will have the \"smart\" vacuum cleaner, the \"smart\" kitchen, \\nthe \"smart\" television, and the like. Also, computers, no matter how \\npowerful, have failed to predict the weather. Although the classical \\nmotion of individual molecules can, in principle, be predicted, the \\nweather is so complex that even someone sneezing can create distortions \\nthat will ripple and be magnified across thousands of miles, eventually, \\nperhaps, unleashing a hurricane. \\n\\nWith all these important caveats, let us determine when a civilization \\n(either our own or one in outer space) may attain the ability to master \\nthe tenth dimension. Astronomer Nikolai Kardashev of the former \\nSoviet Union once categorized future civilizations in the following way. \\n\\nA Type I civilization is one that controls the energy resources of an \\nentire planet. This civilization can control the weather, prevent earth- \\nquakes, mine deep in the earth\\'s crust, and harvest the oceans. This \\ncivilization has already completed the exploration of its solar system. \\n\\nA Type II civilization is one that controls the power of the sun itself. \\n\\n\\n\\n278 \\n\\n\\nMASTERS OF HYPERSPACE \\n\\n\\nThis does not mean passively harnessing solar energy; this civilization \\nmines the sun. The energy needs of this civilization are so large that it \\ndirectly consumes the power of the sun to drive its machines. This civi- \\nlization will begin the colonization of local star systems. \\n\\nA Type III civilization is one that controls the power of an entire \\ngalaxy. For a power source, it harnesses the power of billions of star \\nsystems. It has probably mastered Einstein\\'s equations and can manip- \\nulate space-time at will. \\n\\nThe basis of this classification is rather simple: Each level is catego- \\nrized on the basis of the power source that energizes the civilization. \\nType I civilizations use the power of an entire planet. Type II civilizations \\nuse the power of an entire star. Type III civilizations use the power of \\nan entire galaxy. This classification ignores any predictions concerning \\nthe detailed nature of future civilizations (which are bound to be wrong) \\nand instead focuses on aspects that can be reasonably understood by the \\nlaws of physics, such as energy supply. \\n\\nOur civilization, by contrast, can be categorized as a Type 0 civiliza- \\ntion, one that isjust beginning to tap planetary resources, but does not \\nhave the technology and resources to control them. A Type 0 civilization \\nlike ours derives its energy from fossil fuels like oil and coal and, in much \\nof the Third World, from raw human labor. Our largest computers can- \\nnot even predict the weather, let alone control it. Viewed from this larger \\nperspective, we as a civilization are like a newborn infant. \\n\\nAlthough one might guess that the slow march from a Type 0 civili- \\nzation to a Type III civilization might take millions of years, the extraor- \\ndinary fact about this classification scheme is that this climb is an expo- \\nnential one and hence proceeds much faster than anything we can \\nreadily conceive. \\n\\nWith all these qualifications, we can still make educated guesses \\nabout when our civilization will reach these milestones. Given the rate \\nat which our civilization is growing, we might expect to reach Type I \\nstatus within a few centuries. \\n\\nFor example, the largest energy source available to our Type 0 civi- \\nlization is the hydrogen bomb. Our technology is so primitive that we \\ncan unleash the power of hydrogen fusion only by detonating a bomb, \\nrather than controlling it in a power generator. However, a simple hur- \\nricane generates the power of hundreds of hydrogen bombs. Thus \\nweather control, which is one feature ofType I civilizations, is at least a \\ncentury away from today\\'s technology. \\n\\nSimilarly, a Type I civilization has already colonized most of its solar \\nsystem. By contrast, milestones in today\\'s development of space travel \\n\\n\\n\\nBeyond the Future \\n\\n\\n279 \\n\\n\\nare painfully measured on the scale of decades, and therefore qualitative \\nleaps such as space colonization must be measured in centuries. For \\nexample, the earliest date for NASA\\'s manned landing on the planet \\nMars is 2020. Therefore, the colonization of Mars may take place 40 to \\n50 years after that, and the colonization of the solar system within a \\ncentury. \\n\\nBy contrast, the transition from a Type I to a Type II civilization may \\ntake only 1,000 years. Given the exponential growth of civilization, we \\nmay expect that within 1,000 years the energy needs of a civilization will \\nbecome so large that it must begin to mine the sun to energize its \\nmachines. \\n\\nA typical example of a Type II civilization is the Federation of Planets \\nportrayed in the \"Star Trek\" series. This civilization has just begun to \\nmaster the gravitational force \\xe2\\x80\\x94 that is, the art of warping space-time via \\nwormholes \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and hence, for the first time, has the capability of reaching \\nnearby stars. It has evaded the limit placed by the speed of light by \\nmastering Einstein\\'s theory of general relativity. Small colonies have \\nbeen established on some of these systems, which the starship Enterprise \\nis sworn to protect. The civilization\\'s starships are powered by the col- \\nlision of matter and antimatter. The ability to create large concentrations \\nof antimatter suitable for space travel places that civilization many cen- \\nturies to a millennium away from ours. \\n\\nAdvancing to a Type III civilization may take several thousand years \\nor more. This is, in fact, the time scale predicted by Isaac Asimov in his \\nclassic Foundation Series, which describes the rise, fall, and re-emer- \\ngence of a galactic civilization. The time scale involved in each of these \\ntransitions involves thousands of years. This civilization has harnessed \\nthe energy source contained within the galaxy itself. To it, warp drive, \\ninstead of being an exotic form of travel to the nearby stars, is the stan- \\ndard means of trade and commerce between sectors of the galaxy. Thus \\nalthough it took 2 million years for our species to leave the safety of the \\nforests and build a modern civilization, it may take only thousands of \\nyears to leave the safety of our solar system and build a galactic civiliza- \\ntion. \\n\\nOne option open to a Type III civilization is harnessing the power \\nof supernovae or black holes. Its starships may even be able to probe the \\ngalactic nucleus, which is perhaps the most mysterious of all energy \\nsources. Astrophysicists have theorized that because of the enormous \\nsize of the galactic nucleus, the center of our galaxy may contain millions \\nof black holes. If true, this would provide virtually unlimited amounts of \\nenergy. \\n\\n\\n\\n280 \\n\\n\\nMASTERS OF HYPERSPACE \\n\\n\\nAt this point, manipulating energies a million billion times larger \\nthan present-day energies should be possible. Thus for a Type III civili- \\nzation, with the energy output of uncountable star systems and perhaps \\nthe galactic nucleus at its disposal, the mastery of the tenth dimension \\nbecomes a real possibility. \\n\\n\\nAstrochicken \\n\\nI once had lunch with physicist Freeman Dyson of the Institute for \\nAdvanced Study. Dyson is a senior figure in the world of physics who has \\ntackled some of the most intellectually challenging and intriguing ques- \\ntions facing humanity, such as new directions in space exploration, the \\nnature of extraterrestrial life, and the future of civilization. \\n\\nUnlike other physicists, who dwell excessively in narrow, well-defined \\nareas of specialization, Dyson\\'s fertile imagination has roamed across \\nthe galaxy. \"I cannot, as Bohr and Feynman did, sit for years with my \\nwhole mind concentrated upon one deep question. I am interested in \\ntoo many different directions,\" he confessed/ Thin, remarkably spry, \\nwith the owlish expression of an Oxford don, and speaking with a trace \\nof his British accent, he engaged in a long, wide-ranging lunch conver- \\nsation with me, touching on many of the ideas that have fascinated him \\nover the years. \\n\\nViewing the transition of our civilization to Type I status, Dyson finds \\nthat our primitive space program is headed in the wrong direction. The \\ncurrent trend is toward heavier payloads and greater lag time between \\nspace shots, which is severely retarding the exploration of space. In his \\nwritings, he has proposed a radical departure from this trend, based on \\nwhat he calls the Astrochicken. \\n\\nSmall, lightweight, and intelligent, Astrochicken is a versatile space \\nprobe that has a clear advantage over the bulky, exorbitantly expensive \\nspace missions of the past, which have been a bottleneck to space explo- \\nration. \"Astrochicken will weight a kilogram instead ofVoyager\\'s ton,\" \\nhe claims. \"Astrochicken will not be built, it will be grown,\" he adds. \\n\"Astrochicken could be as agile as a hummingbird with a brain weighing \\nno more than a gram .\" 1 \\n\\nIt will be part machine and part animal, using the most advanced \\ndevelopments in bioengineering. It will be small but powerful enough \\nto explore the outer planets, such as Uranus and Neptune. It will not \\nneed huge quantities of rocket fuel; it will be bred and programmed to \\n\"eat\" ice and hydrocarbons found in the rings surrounding the outer \\n\\n\\n\\nBeyond the Future \\n\\n\\n281 \\n\\n\\nplanet. Its genetically engineered stomach will then digest these mate- \\nrials into chemical fuel. Once its appetite has been satisfied, it will then \\nrocket to the next moon or planet. \\n\\nAstrochicken depends on technological breakthroughs in genetic \\nengineering, artificial intelligence, and solar-electric propulsion. Given \\nthe remarkable progress in these ares, Dyson expects that the various \\ntechnologies for Astrochicken may be available by the year 2016. \\n\\nTaking the larger view of the development of civilization, Dyson also \\nbelieves that, at the current rate of development, we may attain Type I \\nstatus within a few centuries. He does not believe that making the tran- \\nsition between the various types of civilizations will be very difficult. He \\nestimates that the difference in size and power separating the various \\ntypes of civilizations is roughly a factor of 10 billion. Although this may \\nseem like a large number, a civilization growing at the sluggish rate of \\n1 percent per year can expect to make the transition between the various \\ncivilizations within 2,500 years. Thus it is almost guaranteed that a civi- \\nlization can steadily progress toward Type III status. \\n\\nDyson has written, \"A society which happens to possess a strong \\nexpansionist drive will expand its habitat from a single planet (Type I) \\nto a biosphere exploiting an entire star (Type II) within a few thousand \\nyears, and from a single star to an entire galaxy (Type III) within a few \\nmillion years. A species which has once passed beyond Type II status is \\ninvulnerable to extinction by even the worst imaginable natural or arti- \\nficial catastrophe.\" 4 \\n\\nHowever, there is one problem. Dyson has concluded that the tran- \\nsition from a Type II to a Type III civilization may pose formidable phys- \\nical difficulties, due mainly to the limitation imposed by the speed of \\nlight. The expansion of a Type II civilization will necessarily proceed at \\nless than the speed of light, which he feel places a severe restriction on \\nits development. \\n\\nWill a Type II civilization break the light barrier and the bonds of \\nspecial relativity by exploring the power of hyperspace? Dyson is not \\nsure. Nothing can be ruled out, but the Planck length, he reminded me, \\nis a fantastically small distance, and the energies required to probe down \\nto that distance are unimaginable. Perhaps, he mused, the Planck length \\nis a natural barrier facing all civilizations. \\n\\nType III Civilizations in Outer Space \\n\\nIf the longjourney to reach Type III status seems remote for our own \\ncivilization, perhaps one day we will meet an extraterrestrial civilization \\n\\n\\n\\n282 \\n\\n\\nMASTERS OF HYPERSPACE \\n\\n\\nthat has already harnessed hyperspace for its needs and is willing to share \\nits technology with us. The puzzle facing us, however, is that we do not \\nsee signs of any advanced civilization in the heavens, at least not in our \\nsolar system or even in our small sector of the galaxy. Our space probes, \\nespecially the Viking landing on Mars in the 1970s and the Voyager mis- \\nsions to Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune in the 1980s, have sent \\nback discouraging information concerning the bleak, lifeless nature of \\nour solar system. \\n\\nThe two most promising planets, Venus and Mars, have turned up \\nno signs of life, let alone advanced civilizations. Venus, named after the \\ngoddess of love, was once envisioned by astronomers as well as romantics \\nto be a lush, tropical planet. Instead, our space probes have found a \\nharsh, barren planet, with a suffocating atmosphere of carbon dioxide, \\nblistering temperatures exceeding 800\\xc2\\xb0F, and toxic rains of sulfuric acid. \\n\\nMars, the focus of speculation even before Orson Welles caused \\npanic in the country in 1938 during the Depression with his fictional \\nbroadcast about an invasion from that planet, has been equally disap- \\npointing. We know it to be a desolate, desert planet without traces of \\nsurface water. Ancient riverbeds and long-vanished oceans have left their \\ndistinctive mark on the surface of Mars, but we see no ruins or any \\nindications of civilization. \\n\\nGoing beyond our solar system, scientists have analyzed the radio \\nemissions from nearby stars with equally fruitless results. Dyson has \\nstressed that any advanced civilization, by the Second Law of Thermo- \\ndynamics, must necessarily generate large quantities of waste heat. Its \\nenergy consumption should be enormous, and a small fraction of that \\nwaste heat should be easily detected by our instruments. Thus, Dyson \\nclaims, by scanning the nearby stars, our instruments should be able find \\nthe telltale fingerprint of waste heat being generated by an advanced \\ncivilization. But no matter where we scan the heavens, we see no traces \\nof waste heat or radio communications from Type I, II, or III civiliza- \\ntions. On our own earth, for example, we have mastered the art of radio \\nand television within the past half-century. Thus an expanding sphere \\nof radio waves, about 50 light-years in radius, surrounds our planet. Any \\nstar within 50 light-years of earth, if it contains intelligent life, should be \\nable to detect our presence. Likewise, any Type II or III civilization \\nshould be broadcasting copious quantities of electromagnetic radiation \\ncontinuously for the past several thousand years, so that any intelligent \\nlife within several thousand light-years of the civilization\\'s planet should \\nbe able to detect its presence. \\n\\nIn 1978, astronomer Paul Horowitz scanned all sunlike star systems \\n\\n\\n\\nBeyond the Future \\n\\n\\n283 \\n\\n\\n(185 in all) within 80 light-years of our solar system, and found no traces \\nof radio emissions from intelligent life. Astronomers Donald Goldsmith \\nand Tobius Owen reported in 1979 a search of more than 600 star sys- \\ntems, also with negative results. This search, called SETI (search for \\nextraterrestrial intelligence), has met with consistent failure. (Encour- \\nagingly, in a rare display of scientific generosity, in 1992 Congress appro- \\npriated $100 million to be spent over a 10-year period for the Eligh \\nResolution Microwave Survey, which will scan the nearby stars for intel- \\nligent life. These funds will make it possible for the gigantic 305-meter \\nfixed radio dish at Arecibo, Puerto Rico, to scan select stars systematically \\nwithin 100 light-years of the earth. This will be complemented by the 34- \\nmeter movable radio antenna at Goldstone, California, which will sweep \\nbroad portions of the night sky. After years of negative results, astrono- \\nmer Frank Drake of the University of California at Santa Cruz is cau- \\ntiously optimistic that they will find some positive signs of intelligent life. \\nHe remarks, \"Many human societies developed science independently \\nthrough a combination of curiosity and trying to create a better life, and \\nI think those same motivations would exist in other creatures.\") \\n\\nThe puzzle deepens when we realize that the probability of intelli- \\ngent life emerging within our galaxy is surprisingly large. Drake even \\nderived a simple equation to calculate the number of planets with intel- \\nligent life forms in the galaxy. \\n\\nOur galaxy, for example, contains about 200 billion stars. To get a \\nballpark figure for the number of stars with intelligent life forms, we can \\nmake the following very crude estimate. We can be conservative and say \\nthat 10% of these stars are yellow stars much like the sun, that 10% of \\nthose have planets orbiting them, that 10% of those have earthlike plan- \\nets, that 10% of those have earthlike planets with atmospheres compat- \\nible with life, that 10% have earthlike atmospheres with life forms grow- \\ning in them, and that 10% of those have some form of intelligent life. \\nThis means that one-millionth of the 200 billion stars in the galaxy will \\nprobably have some intelligent life form. This implies that a staggering \\n200,000 stars will have planets harboring some form of intelligent life. \\nA slightly more optimistic set of values for Drake\\'s equation shows that \\nintelligent life might be, on the average, as close as 15 light-years from \\nour sun. \\n\\nWith recent advanced computer techniques, scientists have been able \\nto refine Drake\\'s original back-of-the-envelope calculation. George W. \\nWetherill of the Carnegie Institution of Washington, for example, has \\nrun computer simulations of the early evolution of our solar system, \\nbeginning with a large, swirling disk of gas and dust around the sun. He \\n\\n\\n\\n284 \\n\\n\\nMASTERS OF HYPERSPACE \\n\\n\\nlets the computer evolve the disk until small, rocky masses begin to coa- \\nlesce out of the dust. Much to his pleasant surprise, he found that planets \\nof approximately the size of the earth were easy to evolve out of these \\nrocky cores. Most of the time, in fact, earth-size planets spontaneously \\ncoalesced with masses between 80% and 130% of the earth\\'s distance \\nfrom the sun. (Curiously, he also found that the formation ofjupiter- \\nsize planets far from the sun was important for the evolution of the earth- \\nsize planets. The Jupiter-size planets were essential to sweep out swarms \\nof comets and debris that would eventually strike the earthlike planet, \\nextinguishing any primitive life forms on it. Wetherill\\'s computer sim- \\nulations show that without a Jupiter-like planet to clean out these comets \\nwith its gigantic gravitational pull, these comets would hit the earthlike \\nplanet about 1,000 times more frequently than they do in reality, making \\na life-destroying impact every 100,000 years or so.) \\n\\nThus it is a compelling (but certainly not rigorous) conclusion that \\nthe laws of probability favor the presence of other intelligence within \\nthe galaxy. The fact that our galaxy is perhaps 10 billion years old means \\nthat there has been ample time for scores of intelligent life forms to have \\nflourished within it. Type II and III civilizations, broadcasting for several \\nhundred to several thousand years, should be sending out an easily \\ndetectable sphere of electromagnetic radiation measuring several hun- \\ndred to several thousand light-years in diameter. Yet we see no signs of \\nintelligent life forms in the heavens. \\n\\nWhy? \\n\\nSeveral speculative theories have been advanced to explain why we \\nhave been unable to detect signs of intelligent life out to 100 light-years \\nof our planet. None of them is particularly satisfying, and the final truth \\nmay be a combination of all of them. \\n\\nOne theory holds that Drake\\'s equation may give us rough proba- \\nbilities of how many planets contain intelligent life, but tells us nothing \\nabout when these planets attain this level of development. Given the \\nastronomical time scales involved, perhaps Drake\\'s equation predicts \\nintelligent life forms that existed millions of years before us, or will exist \\nmillions of years after us. \\n\\nFor example, our solar system is approximately 4.5 billion years old. \\nLife started on the earth about 3 to 4 billion years ago, but only within \\nthe past million years has intelligent life developed on the planet (and \\nonly within the past few decades has this civilization built radio stations \\ncapable of sending signals into outer space). However, 1 million years, \\non the time scale of billions of years, is but an instant of time. It is \\nreasonable to assume that thousands of advanced civilizations existed \\n\\n\\n\\nBeyond the Future \\n\\n\\n285 \\n\\n\\nbefore our distant ancestors even left the forest and have since perished, \\nor that thousands more civilizations will develop long after ours has died. \\nEither way, we would not be able to detect them via our instruments. \\n\\nThe second theory holds that the galaxy is, in fact, teeming with \\nadvanced forms of civilizations, but they are advanced enough to conceal \\ntheir existence from our prying instruments. We would mean nothing \\nto them because they are so many millions of years ahead of us. For \\nexample, if we stumble on an ant colony while walking in a field, our \\nfirst impulse is certainly not to make contact with the ants, ask to see \\ntheir leader, wave trinkets before their eyes, and offer them unparalleled \\nprosperity and the fruits of our advanced technology. More likely, our \\nfirst temptation is to ignore them (or perhaps even step on a few of \\nthem). \\n\\nPuzzled by these long-standing questions, I asked Dyson if he thought \\nwe would soon be making contact with extraterrestrial life forms. His \\nanswer rather surprised me. He said, \"I hope not.\" I thought it was \\nstrange that someone who had spent decades speculating about intelli- \\ngent civilizations in outer space should have reservations about actually \\nmeeting them. Knowing British history, however, he must have had good \\nreasons for not rushing in to embrace other civilizations. British civili- \\nzation was probably only several hundred years more advanced than \\nmany of the civilizations, such as the Indian and the African, conquered \\nby the British army and navy. \\n\\nAlthough most science-fiction writers bewail the limitations on space \\nexploration placed by the speed of light, Dyson takes the unorthodox \\nview that perhaps this is a good thing. Viewing the often bloody history \\nof colonialism throughout our own world history, perhaps it is a blessing \\nin disguise, he muses, that various Type II civilizations will be separated \\nby large distances and that the Planck energy is inaccessible. Looking at \\nthe bright side, he quipped, \"At least, one can evade the tax collector.\" \\n\\nUnfortunately, the meeting of two unequal civilizations has often had \\ncatastrophic implications for the weaker one. For example, the Aztec \\ncivilization had risen over thousands of years to great prominence in \\ncentral Mexico. In some areas, its mastery of science, art, and technology \\nrivaled the achievements of Europe. However, in the area of gunpowder \\nand warships, the Aztecs were perhaps several centuries behind the \\nSpanish. The sudden clash between a small, ragged band of 400 con- \\nquistadors and the advanced civilizations of the Aztecs ended in tragedy \\nin 1521. Within a brief period of time, the Aztec people, with a popu- \\nlation numbering in the millions, were systematically crushed and \\nenslaved to work in the mines. Their treasuries were looted, their history \\n\\n\\n\\n286 \\n\\n\\nMASTERS OF HYPERSPACE \\n\\n\\nwas erased, and even the faintest memory of the great Aztec civilization \\nwas obliterated by waves of missionaries. \\n\\nWhen we think of how we might react to visitors from outer space, \\nit is sobering to read how the Aztecs reacted to the visitors from Spain: \\n\"They seized upon the gold as if they were monkeys, their faces gleam- \\ning. For clearly their thirst for gold was insatiable; they starved for it; \\nthey lusted for it; they wanted to stuff themselves with it as if they were \\npigs. So they went about fingering, taking up the streamers of gold, \\nmoving them back and forth, grabbing them to themselves, babbling, \\ntalking gibberish among themselves.\"*\\xe2\\x80\\x99 \\n\\nOn a cosmic scale, the sudden interactions between civilizations \\ncould be even more dramatic. Because we are talking about astronomical \\ntime scales, it is likely that a civilization that is a million years ahead of \\nus will find us totally uninteresting. Furthermore, there is probably little \\nthat our planet can offer these aliens in terms of natural resources that \\nisn\\'t simultaneously available in numerous other star systems. \\n\\nIn the \"Star Trek\" series, however, the Federation of Planets encoun- \\nters other hostile civilizations, the Klingons and Romulans, which are \\nprecisely at the same stage of technological development as the Federa- \\ntion. This may increase the drama and tension of the series, but the odds \\nof this happening are truly astronomical. More likely, as we venture off \\ninto the galaxy in starships, we will encounter civilizations at vastly dif- \\nferent levels of technological development, some perhaps millions of \\nyears ahead of us. \\n\\n\\nThe Rise and Fall of Civilizations \\n\\nIn addition to the possibilities that we may have missed other civilizations \\nby millions of years and that other civilizations may not consider us wor- \\nthy of notice, a third theory, which is more interesting, holds that \\nthousands of intelligent life forms did arise from the swamp, but they \\nwere unable to negotiate a series of catastrophes, both natural and self- \\n\\n\\n*So perhaps we shouldn\\'t be so enthusiastic about making contact with intelligent \\nextraterrestrials. Scientists point out that on the earth, there are two types of animals: \\npredators like cats, dogs, and tigers (which have eyes to the front of their face, so they can \\nstereoscopically zero in on their target) and prey like rabbits and deer (which have eyes \\nto the side of their face in order to look around 360 degrees for the predators). Typically, \\npredators are more intelligent then prey. Tests show that cats are more intelligent than \\nmice, and foxes are more intelligent than rabbits. Humans, with eyes to the front, are also \\npredators. In our search for intelligent life in the heavens, we should keep in mind that \\nthe aliens we meet will probably also have evolved from predators. \\n\\n\\n\\nBeyond the Future \\n\\n\\n287 \\n\\n\\ninflicted. If this theory is correct, then perhaps someday our starships \\nwill find the ruins of ancient civilizations on far-off planets, or, more \\nlikely, our own civilization will be faced with these catastrophes. Instead \\nof becoming \"lords of the universe,\" we may follow the road to self- \\ndestruction. Thus the question we ask is: What is the fate of advanced \\ncivilizations? Will we (they) survive long enough to master the physics \\nof the tenth dimension? \\n\\nThe rise of civilizations is not marked by a steady and sure growth in \\ntechnology and knowledge. History shows us that civilizations rise, \\nmature, and then disappear, sometimes without a trace. In the future, \\nperhaps humanity will unleash a Pandora\\'s box of technological horrors \\nthat threaten our very existence, from atomic bombs to carbon dioxide. \\nFar from trumpeting the coming of the Age of Aquarius, some futurol- \\nogists predict that we may be facing technological and ecological col- \\nlapse. For the future, they conjure up the frightening image ofhumanity \\nreduced to a pathetic, terrified Scrooge in Charles Dickens\\'s fable, grov- \\neling on the ground of his own grave and pleading for a second chance. \\n\\nUnfortunately, the bulk ofhumanity is largely uncaring, or unaware, \\nof the potential disasters facing us. Some scientists have argued that \\nperhaps humanity, considered as a single entity, can be compared to a \\nteenager careening out of control. For example, psychologists tell us that \\nteenagers act as if they are invulnerable. Their driving, drinking, and \\ndrug habits are graphic proof, they say, of the devil-may-care recklessness \\nthat pervades their life-style and outlook. The main cause of death \\namong teenagers in this country is no longer disease, but accidents, \\nprobably caused by the fact that they think they will live forever. \\n\\nIf that is true, then we are abusing technology and the environment \\nas ifwe will live forever, unaware of the catastrophes that lie in the future. \\nSociety as a whole may have a \"Peter Pan complex,\" never wanting to \\ngrow up and face the consequences of its own irresponsibility. \\n\\nTo concretize our discussion, using the knowledge at our disposal, \\nwe can identify several important hurdles that must be crossed over dur- \\ning the next several aeons before we can become masters of the tenth \\ndimension: the uranium barrier, ecological collapse, a new ice age, astro- \\nnomical close encounters, Nemesis and extinction, and the death of the \\nsun and the Milky Way galaxy. \\n\\nThe Uranium Barrier \\n\\nJonathan Schell, in his watershed book The Fate of the Earth, points out \\nhow perilously close we have come to mutual annihilation. Although the \\n\\n\\n\\n288 \\n\\n\\nMASTERS OF HYPERSPACE \\n\\n\\nrecent collapse of the Soviet Union has made possible sweeping arms \\ncuts, there are still close to 50,000 nuclear weapons, both tactical and \\nstrategic, in the world today, and with deadly accurate rockets to deliver \\nthem. Humanity has finally mastered the possibility of total annihilation. \\n\\nIf the missiles do not destroy everyone in the opening shots of a \\nnuclear war. we can still look forward to the agonizing death caused by \\nnuclear winter, during which the soot and ash from burning cities slowly \\nchokes off all the life-giving sunlight. Computer studies have shown that \\nas few as 100 megatons of explosives may generate enough fire storms \\nin the cities to cloud the atmosphere significantly. As temperatures \\nplummet, crops fail, and cities freeze over, the last vestiges of civilization \\nwill be snuffed out like a candle. \\n\\nFinally, there is the increasing danger of nuclear proliferation. \\nUnited States intelligence estimates that India, which detonated its first \\nbomb in 1974. now has a stockpile of about 20 atomic bombs. Arch- \\nenemy Pakistan, these sources claim, has built four atomic bombs, one \\nof which weighs no more than 400 pounds, at its secret Kahuta nuclear \\nfacility. An atomic worker at Israel\\'s Dirnona nuclear installation in the \\nNegev desert claimed that he saw enough material to build 200 atomic \\nbombs there. And South Africa admitted that it had made seven atomic \\nbombs and apparently tested two atomic bombs in the late 1970s off its \\ncoast. The U.S. spy satellite Vela picked up the \"fingerprint\" of the \\natomic bomb, a characteristic, unmistakable double-flash, on two occa- \\nsions off the coast of South Africa in the presence of Israeli warships. \\nNations like North Korea, South Korea, and Taiwan are poised at the \\nbrink of going nuclear. It\\'s highly probable, given recent U.S. intelli- \\ngence disclosures, that 20 nations will possess the bomb by the year 2000. \\nThe bomb will have proliferated into the hottest spots around the world, \\nincluding the Middle East. \\n\\nThis situation is highly unstable, and will continue to become more \\nso as nations compete for diminishing resources and spheres of influ- \\nence. Notjust our society, but every intelligent civilization in the galaxy \\nbuilding an industrial society, will discover element 92 (uranium) and \\nwith it the ability for mass destruction. Element 92 has the curious prop- \\nerty of sustaining a chain reaction and releasing the vast amount of \\nenergy stored within its nucleus. With the ability to master element 92 \\ncomes the ability either to liberate our species from want, ignorance, \\nand hunger, or to consume the planet in nuclear fire. The power of \\nelement 92, however, can be unleashed only when an intelligent species \\nreaches a certain point of development as a Type 0 civilization. It \\ndepends on the size of its cohesive social unit and its state of industrial \\ndevelopment. \\n\\n\\n\\nBeyond the Future \\n\\n\\n289 \\n\\n\\nFire, for example, can be harnessed by isolated groups of intelligent \\nindividuals (such as a tribe). Smelting and primitive metallurgy, neces- \\nsary for the manufacture of weapons, requires a larger social unit, per- \\nhaps numbering in the thousands (such as a small village). The devel- \\nopment of the internal-combustion engine (for example, a car engine) \\nrequires the development of a complex chemical and industrial base, \\nwhich can be accomplished by only a cohesive social unit numbering in \\nthe millions (for example, a nation-state). \\n\\nThe discovery of element 92 upsets this balance between the slow, \\nsteady rise of the cohesive social unit and its technological development. \\nThe releasing of nuclear energy dwarfs chemical explosives by a factor \\nof a million, but the same nation-state that can harness the internal- \\ncombustion engine can also refine element 92. Thus a severe mismatch \\noccurs, especially when the social development of this hypothetical civ- \\nilization is still locked in the form of hostile nation-states. The technol- \\nogy for mayhem and destruction abruptly outpaces the slow develop- \\nment of social relations with the discovery of element 92. \\n\\nIt is natural to conclude, therefore, that Type 0 civilizations arose on \\nnumerous occasions within the past 5- to 10-billion-year history of our \\ngalaxy, but that they all eventually discovered element 92. If a civiliza- \\ntion\\'s technological capability outraced its social development, then, \\nwith the rise of hostile nation-states, there was a large chance that the \\ncivilization destroyed itself long ago in an atomic war. Regrettably, if we \\nlive long enough to reach nearby stars in our sector of the galaxy, we \\nmay see the ashes of numerous, dead civilizations that settled national \\npassions, personal jealousies, and racial hatreds with nuclear bombs. \\n\\nAs Heinz Pagels has said. \\n\\nThe challenge to our civilization which has come from our knowledge of \\nthe cosmic energies that fuel the stars, the movement of light and electrons \\nthrough matter, the intricate molecular order which is the biological basis \\nof life, must be met by the creation of a moral and political order which \\nwill accommodate these forces or we shall be destroyed. It will try our \\ndeepest resources of reason and compassion. \\n\\n\\nIt seems likely, therefore, that advanced civilizations sprang up on \\nnumerous occasions within our galaxy, but that few of them negotiated \\nthe uranium barrier, especially if their technology outpaced their social \\ndevelopment. \\n\\nIf we plot, for example, the rise of radio technology on a graph, we \\nsee that our planet evolved for 5 billion years before an intelligent spe- \\ncies discovered how to manipulate the electromagnetic and nuclear \\n\\n\\n\\n290 \\n\\n\\nMASTERS OF HYPERSPACE \\n\\n\\nforces. However, if we annihilate ourselves in a nuclear war, then this \\ncurve will become a spike and return to zero. Thus in order to com- \\nmunicate with an advanced civilization, we must scan at precisely the \\nright era, to an accuracy of a few decades, before the civilization blows \\nitself up. There is a vanishingly small \"window\" through which we may \\nmake contact with another living civilization, before it destroys itself. In \\nFigure 13.1, we see the rise of alien civilizations throughout the galaxy \\nrepresented as a series of peaks, each representing the rapid rise of a \\ncivilization and the even more rapid fall due to nuclear war. Scanning \\nthe heavens for intelligent life, therefore, may be a difficult task. Perhaps \\nthere have been many thousands of peaks within the past few billion \\nyears, with thousands of planets briefly mastering radio technology \\nbefore blowing themselves up. Each brief peak, unfortunately, takes \\nplace at different cosmic times. \\n\\nEcological Collapse \\n\\nAssuming that a Type 0 civilization can master uranium without destroy- \\ning itself in a nuclear war, the next barrier is the possibility of ecological \\ncollapse. \\n\\nWe recall the earlier example of a single bacterium, which divides so \\nfrequently that it eventually outweighs the planet earth. However, in \\nreality we do not see gigantic masses of bacteria on the earth \\xe2\\x80\\x94 in fact, \\nbacterial colonies usually do not even grow to the size of a penny. Lab- \\noratory bacteria placed in a dish filled with nutrients will indeed grow \\nexponentially, but eventually die because they produce too much waste \\nand exhaust the food supply. These bacterial colonies essentially suffo- \\ncate in their own waste products. \\n\\nLike bacterial colonies, we may also be exhausting our resources \\nwhile drowning in the waste products that we relentlessly produce. Our \\noceans and the atmosphere are not limitless, but ultrathin films on the \\nsurface of the earth. The population of a Type 0 civilization, before it \\nreaches Type I status, may soar to the billions, creating a strain on \\nresources and exacerbating the problems of pollution. One of the most \\nimmediate dangers is the poisoning of the atmosphere, in the form of \\ncarbon dioxide, which traps sunlight and raises the average world tem- \\nperature, possibly initiating a runaway greenhouse effect. \\n\\nSince 1958, carbon dioxide concentrations in the air have increased \\n25%, mostly from oil and coal burning (45% of carbon dioxide comes \\nfrom the United States and the former Soviet Union). This, in turn, may \\nhave accelerated the mean temperature rise of the earth. It took almost \\n\\n\\n\\nBeyond the Future \\n\\n\\n291 \\n\\n\\n\\nBillions of years \\n\\nFigure 13.1. Why don\\'t we see other intelligent life in the galaxy ? Perhaps intel- \\nligent life forms that could build radio telescopes flourished millions of years in \\nthe past, but perished in a nuclear war. Our galaxy could have been teeming with \\nintelligent life, but perhaps most are dead now. Will our civilization be any dif- \\nferent? \\n\\n\\na century, from 1880, to raise the mean world temperature 1\\xc2\\xb0F. However, \\nthe mean temperature is now rising at almost 0.6\\xc2\\xb0F per decade. By the \\nyear 2050, this translates into a rise of coastal waters by 1 to 4 feet, which \\ncould swamp nations like Bangladesh and flood areas like Los Angeles \\nand Manhattan. Even more serious would be a devastation of the \\nnation\\'s food basket in the Midwest, the acceleration of the spread of \\ndeserts, and destruction of tropical rain forests, which in turn accelerates \\nthe greenhouse effect. Famine and economic ruin could spread on a \\nglobal scale. \\n\\nThe fault lies in an uncoordinated planetary policy. Pollution takes \\nplace in millions of individual factories all over the planet, but the power \\nto curb this unbridled pollution resides with a planetary policy, which is \\ndifficult, if not impossible, to enforce if the dominant cohesive social \\nunit is the nation-state, numbering only in the hundreds of millions. In \\nthe short term, this may mean emergency policies and the sharp cur- \\ntailment of the internal-combustion engine and coal and oil burning. \\nThe standard of living could also drop. It means additional hardships in \\n\\n\\n\\n292 \\n\\n\\nMASTERS OF HYPERSPACE \\n\\n\\ndeveloping nations, which need access to cheap sources of energy. In \\nthe long term, however, our society may be forced to resort to one of \\nthree possible solutions that do not give off carbon dioxide and are \\nessentially inexhaustible: solar energy, fusion plants, and breeder reac- \\ntors. Of these, solar and fusion hold the most promise. Fusion power \\n(which fuses the hydrogen atoms found in sea water) and solar energy \\nare still several decades away, but should provide ample energy supplies \\ninto the next few centuries, until society makes the transition to a Type \\nI civilization. \\n\\nThe fault once again lies in the fact that the technology has outpaced \\nsocial development. As long as pollution is produced by individual \\nnation-states, while the measures necessary to correct this are planetary, \\nthere will be a fatal mismatch that invites disaster. The uranium barrier \\nand ecological collapse will exist as life-threatening disasters for Type 0 \\ncivilizations until this mismatch is bridged. \\n\\nOnce a civilization passes Type 0 status, however, there is much more \\nroom for optimism. To reach Type I status requires a remarkable degree \\nof social cooperation on a planetary scale. Aggregates on the order of \\ntens to hundreds of millions of individuals are necessary to exploit the \\nresources of uranium, internal combustion, and chemicals. However, \\naggregates on the order of billions are probably necessary truly to har- \\nness planetary resources. Thus the social organization of a Type I civi- \\nlization must be very complex and very advanced, or else the technology \\ncannot be developed. \\n\\nBy definition, a Type I civilization requires a cohesive social unit that \\nis the entire planet\\'s population. A Type I civilization by its very nature \\nmust be a planetary civilization. It cannot function on a smaller scale. \\n\\nThis can, in some sense, be compared to childbirth. The most dan- \\ngerous period for a child is the first few months of life, when the tran- \\nsition to an external, potentially hostile environment places enormous \\nbiological strains on the baby. After the first year of life, the death rate \\nplunges dramatically. Similarly, the most dangerous period for a civili- \\nzation is the first few centuries after it has reached nuclear capability. It \\nmay turn out that once a civilization has achieved a planetary political \\nsystem, the worst is over. \\n\\nA New Ice Age \\n\\nNo one knows what causes an ice age, which has a duration measured \\nin tens to hundreds of thousands of years. One theory is that it is caused \\nby minute variations in the earth\\'s rotation, which are too small to be \\n\\n\\n\\nBeyond the Future \\n\\n\\n293 \\n\\n\\nnoticed even over a period of centuries. These tiny effects, over hun- \\ndreds of thousands of years, apparently accumulate to cause slight \\nchanges in thejet stream over the poles. Eventually, thejet streams are \\ndiverted, sending freezing polar air masses farther and farther south, \\ncausing temperatures to plummet around the globe, until an ice age \\nbegins. The ice ages did considerable damage to the ecology of the \\nearth, wiping out scores of mammalian life forms and perhaps even iso- \\nlating bands of humans on different continents, perhaps even giving rise \\nto the various races, which is a relatively recent phenomenon. \\n\\nUnfortunately, our computers are too primitive even to predict \\ntomorrow\\'s weather, let alone when the next ice age will strike. For \\nexample, computers are now entering their fifth generation. We some- \\ntimes forget that no matter how large or complex a fourth-generation \\ncomputer is, it can only add two numbers at a time. This is an enormous \\nbottleneck that isjust beginning to be solved with fifth-generation com- \\nputers, which have parallel processors that can perform several opera- \\ntions simultaneously. \\n\\nIt is highly likely that our civilization (if it successfully negotiates the \\nuranium barrier and ecological collapse) will attain Type I status, and \\nwith it the ability to control the weather, within a few hundred years. If \\nhumanity reaches Type I status or higher before the next ice age occurs, \\nthen there is ample reason to believe that an ice age will not destroy \\nhumanity. Humans either will change the weather and prevent the ice \\nage or will leave the earth. \\n\\nAstronomical Close Encounters \\n\\nOn a time scale of several thousand to several million years, Types 0 and \\nI civilizations have to worry about asteroid collisions and nearby super- \\nnovas. \\n\\nOnly within this century, with refined astronomical measurements, \\nhas it become apparent that the earth\\'s orbit cuts across the orbits of \\nmany asteroids, making the possibility of near misses uncomfortably \\nlarge. (One way for a Type 0 or I civilization to prevent a direct collision \\nis to send rockets with hydrogen bombs to intercept and deflect the \\nasteroid while it is still tens of millions of miles away from the earth. This \\nmethod has, in fact, been proposed by international bodies of scientists.) \\n\\nThese near misses are more frequent than most people realize. The \\nlast one took place on January 3, 1993, and was actually photographed \\nusing radar by NASA astronomers. Photos of the asteroid Toutatis show \\nthat it consists of two rocky cores, each 2 miles in diameter. It came \\n\\n\\n\\n294 \\n\\n\\nMASTERS OF HYPERSPACE \\n\\n\\nwithin 2.2 million miles of the planet earth. On March 23, 1989, an \\nasteroid about half a mile across drifted even closer to the earth, about \\n0.7 million miles (roughly three times the distance from the earth to the \\nmoon). \\n\\nIn fact, it was also announced in late 1992 that a gigantic comet would \\nhit the earth on exactly August 14, 2126, perhaps ending all life on the \\nplanet. Astronomer Brian Marsden of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center \\nfor Astrophysics estimated the chances of a direct hit as 1 in 10,000. The \\nSwift-Tuttle comet (named after the two American astronomers who \\nfirst spotted it during the Civil War) was soon dubbed the Doomsday \\nRock by the media. Soon-to-be-unemployed nuclear weapons physicists \\nargued, perhaps in a self-serving way, that they should be allowed to \\nbuild massive hydrogen bombs to blow it to smithereens when the time \\ncomes. \\n\\nBits and pieces of the Swift-Tuttle comet have already impacted on \\nthe earth. Making a complete revolution around the sun every 130 years, \\nit sheds a considerable amount of debris, creating a river of meteors and \\nparticles in outer space. When the earth crosses this river, we have the \\nannual Perseid meteor shower, which rarely fails to light up the sky with \\ncelestial fireworks. (We should also point out that predicting near misses \\nof comets is a risky business. Because the heat of the sun\\'s radiation \\ncauses the comet\\'s icy surface to vaporize irregularly and sputter like \\nthousands of small firecrackers, there are slight but important distor- \\ntions in its trajectory. Not surprisingly, Marsden retracted his prediction \\na few weeks later as being incorrect. \"We\\'re safe for the next millen- \\nnium,\" admitted Marsden.) \\n\\nA NASA panel in January 1991 estimated that there are about 1,000 \\nto 4,000 asteroids that cross the earth\\'s orbit and are bigger than a half- \\nmile across, sufficient to pose a threat to human civilization. However, \\nonly about 150 of these large asteroids have been adequately tracked by \\nradar. Furthermore, there are estimated to be about 300,000 asteroids \\nthat cross the earth\\'s orbit that are at least 300 feet across. Unfortunately, \\nscientists hardly know the orbits of any of these smaller asteroids. \\n\\nMy own personal close encounter with an extraterrestrial object came \\nwhen I was a senior at Harvard in the winter of 1967. A close friend of \\nmine in my dormitory, who had a part-time job at the university obser- \\nvatory, told me a closely held secret: The astronomers there had detected \\na gigantic asteroid, several miles across, heading directly for the planet \\nearth. Furthermore, although it was too early to tell, he informed me \\nthat their computers calculated it might strike the earth in June 1968, \\n\\n\\n\\nBeyond the Future \\n\\n\\n295 \\n\\n\\nthe time of our graduation. An object that size would crack the earth\\'s \\ncrust, spew open billions oftons ofmolten magma, and send huge earth- \\nquakes and tidal waves around the world. As the months went by, I would \\nget periodic updates on the course of the Doomsday asteroid. The \\nastronomers at the observatory were obviously being careful not to cause \\nany undue panic with this information. \\n\\nTwenty years later, I had forgotten all about the asteroid, until I was \\nbrowsing through an article on asteroid near misses. Sure enough, the \\narticle made reference to the asteroid of 1968. Apparently, the asteroid \\ncame within about 1 million miles of a direct impact with the earth. \\n\\nMore rare, but more spectacular than asteroid collisions are super- \\nnova bursts in the vicinity of the earth. A supernova releases enormous \\nquantities of energy, greater than the output of hundreds of billions of \\nstars, until eventually it outshines the entire galaxy itself. It creates a \\nburst of x-rays, which would be sufficient to cause severe disturbances in \\nany nearby star system. At the very minimum, a nearby supernova would \\ncreate a gigantic EMP (electromagnetic pulse), similar to the one that \\nwould be unleashed by a hydrogen bomb detonated in outer space. The \\nx-ray burst would eventually hit our atmosphere, smashing electrons out \\nof atoms; the electrons would then spiral through the earth\\'s magnetic \\nfield, creating enormous electric fields. These fields are sufficient to \\nblack out all electrical and communication devices for hundreds of \\nmiles, creating confusion and panic. In a large-scale nuclear war, the \\nEMP would be sufficient to wipe out or damage any form of electronics \\nover a wide area of the earth\\'s population. At worst, in fact, a supernova \\nburst in the vicinity of a star system might be sufficient to destroy all life. \\n\\nAstronomer Carl Sagan speculates that such an event may have wiped \\nout the dinosaurs: \\n\\n\\nIf there were by chance a supernova within ten or twenty light-years of the \\nsolar system some sixty-five million years ago, it would have sprayed an \\nintense flux of cosmic rays into space, and some of these, entering the \\nEarth\\'s envelope of air, would have burned the atmospheric nitrogen. The \\noxides ofnitrogen thus generated would have removed the protective layer \\nof ozone from the atmosphere, increasing the flux of solar ultraviolet radi- \\nation at the surface and frying and mutating the many organisms imper- \\nfectly protected against intense ultraviolet light. \\n\\nUnfortunately, the supernova would give little warning of its explo- \\nsion. A supernova eruption takes place quite rapidly, and its radiation \\n\\n\\n\\n296 \\n\\n\\nMASTERS OF HYPERSPACE \\n\\n\\ntravels at the speed of light, so a Type I civilization would have to make \\na speedy escape into outer space. The only precaution that a civilization \\ncan take is to monitor carefully those nearby stars that are on the verge \\nof going supernova. \\n\\n\\nThe Nemesis Extinction Factor \\n\\nIn 1980, the late Luis Alvarez, his son Walter, and Frank Asaro and Helen \\nMichel of the University of California at Berkeley proposed that a comet \\nor an asteroid hit the earth 65 million years ago, thereby initiating vast \\natmospheric disturbances that led to the sudden extinction of the dino- \\nsaurs. By examining the rocky strata laid down by river beds 65 million \\nyears ago, they were able to determine the presence of unusually high \\namounts of iridium, which is rarely found on earth but commonly found \\nin extraterrestrial objects, like meteors. The theory is quite plausible, \\nsince a comet 5 miles in diameter hitting the earth at about 20 miles per \\nsecond (ten times faster than a speeding bullet) would have the force \\nof 100 million megatons of TNT (or 10,000 times the world\\'s total \\nnuclear arsenal). It would create a crater 60 miles across and 20 miles \\ndeep, sending up enough debris to cut off all sunlight for an extended \\nperiod of time. As temperatures fall dramatically, the vast majority of \\nthe species on this planet would be either killed off or seriously \\ndepleted. \\n\\nIn fact, it was announced in 1992 that a strong candidate for the \\ndinosaur-killing comet or asteroid had been identified. It was already \\nknown that there is a large impact crater, measuring 110 miles across, \\nin Mexico, in the Yucatan, near the village ofChicxulub Puerto. In 1981, \\ngeophysicists with the Mexican national petroleum company, Pemex, \\ntold geologists that they had picked up gravitational and magnetic anom- \\nalies that were circular in shape at the site. However, only after Alvarez\\'s \\ntheory became popular did geologists actively analyze the remnants of \\nthat cataclysmic impact. Radioactive-dating methods using argon-39 \\nhave shown that the Yucatan crater is 64.98 \\xc2\\xb1 0.05 million years old. \\nMore impressively, it was shown that Mexico. Haiti, and even Florida are \\nlittered with small, glassy debris called tektites, which were probably sili- \\ncates that were glassified by the impact of this large asteroid or comet. \\nThese glassy tektites can be found in sediment that was laid \\ndown between the Tertiary and Cretaceous periods. Analyses of five \\ndifferent tektite samples show an average age of 65.07 \\xc2\\xb1 0.10 million \\nyears. Given the accuracy of these independent measurements. \\n\\n\\n\\nBeyond the Future \\n\\n\\n297 \\n\\n\\ngeologists now have the \"smoking gun\" for the dinosaur-killing \\nasteroid or comet. \\n\\nBut one of the astonishing features of life on earth is that the extinc- \\ntion of the dinosaurs is but one of several well-documented mass extinc- \\ntions. Other mass extinctions were much worse than the one that ended \\nthe Cretaceous period 65 million years ago. The mass extinction that \\nended the Permian period, for example, destroyed fully 96% of all plant \\nand animal species 250 million years ago. The trilobites, which ruled the \\noceans as one of earth\\'s dominant life forms, mysteriously and abruptly \\nperished during this great mass extinction. In fact, there have been five \\nmass extinctions of animal and plant life. If one includes mass extinc- \\ntions that are less well documented, a pattern becomes evident: Every \\n26 million years or so, there is a mass extinction. Paleontologists David \\nRaup and lohn Sepkoski have shown that if we plot the number of known \\nspecies on the earth at any given time, then the chart shows a sharp drop \\nin the number of life forms on the earth every 26 million years, like \\nclockwork. This can be shown to extend over ten cycles going back 260 \\nmillion years (excluding two cycles). \\n\\nIn one extinction cycle, at the end of the Cretaceous period, 65 mil- \\nlion years ago, most of the dinosaurs were killed off. In another extinc- \\ntion cycle, at the end of the Eocene period, 35 million years ago. many \\nspecies of land mammals were extinguished. But the central puzzle to \\nthis is: What in heaven\\'s name has a cycle time of 26 million years? A \\nsearch through biological, geological, or even astronomical data suggests \\nthat nothing has a cycle time of 26 million years. \\n\\nRichard Muller of Berkeley has theorized that our sun is actually part \\nof a double-star system, and that our sister star (called Nemesis or the \\nDeath Star) is responsible for periodic extinctions of life on the earth. \\nThe conjecture is that our sun has a massive unseen partner that circles \\nit every 26 million years. As it passes through the Oort cloud (a cloud \\nof comets that supposedly exists beyond the orbit of Pluto), it brings \\nwith it an unwelcome avalanche of comets, some of which strike the \\nearth, causing enough debris that the sunlight is blocked from reaching \\nthe earth\\'s surface. \\n\\nExperimental evidence for this unusual theory comes from the fact \\nthat the geological layers from the past, corresponding to the end of \\neach extinction cycle, contain unusually large quantities of the element \\niridium. Since iridium is naturally found in extraterrestrial meteors, it is \\npossible that these traces of iridium are remnants of the comets sent \\ndown by Nemesis. At present, we are half-way between extinction cycles, \\nmeaning that Nemesis, ifit exists, is at its farthest point in its orbit (prob- \\n\\n\\n\\n298 \\n\\n\\nMASTERS OF HYPERSPACE \\n\\n\\nably several light-years away). This would give us over 10 million years \\nor so until its next arrival.* \\n\\nFortunately, by the time comets from the Oort cloud streak through \\nthe solar system again, we will have reached Type III status, meaning \\nthat we will have conquered not just the nearby stars, but travel through \\nspace-time. \\n\\n\\nThe Death of the Sun \\n\\nScientists sometimes wonder what will eventually happen to the atoms \\nof our bodies long after we are dead. The most likely possibility is that \\nour molecules will eventually return to the sun. \\n\\nOur sun is a middle-aged star. It is approximately 5 billion years old, \\nand will probably remain a yellow star for another 5 billion years. When \\nour sun exhausts its supply of hydrogen fuel, however, it will burn helium \\nand become vastly inflated \\xe2\\x80\\x94 a red giant. Its atmosphere will expand rap- \\nidly, eventually extending out to the orbit of Mars, and the earth\\'s orbit \\nwill be entirely within the sun\\'s atmosphere, so that the earth will be \\nfried by the sun\\'s enormous temperatures. The molecules making up \\nour bodies, and in fact the earth itself, will be consumed by the solar \\natmosphere. \\n\\nSagan paints the following picture: \\n\\n\\nBillions of years from now, there will be a last perfect day on Earth. . . . \\nThe Arctic and Antarctic icecaps will melt, flooding the coasts of the world. \\nThe high oceanic temperatures will release more water vapor into the air, \\nincreasing cloudiness, shielding the Earth from sunlight and delaying the \\nend a little. But solar evolution is inexorable. Eventually the oceans will \\nboil, the atmosphere will evaporate away to space and a catastrophe of the \\nmost immense proportions imaginable will overtake our planet . 8 \\n\\n\\nThus, for those who wish to know whether the earth will be consumed \\nin ice or fire, physics actually gives a definite answer. It will be consumed \\nin fire. However, it is highly likely that humans, if we have survived that \\n\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Another theory that might explain periodic extinctions on this vast time scale is the \\norbit of our solar system around the Milky Way galaxy. The solar System actually dips below \\nand above the galactic plane in its orbit around the galaxy, much like carousel horses move \\nup and down as a merry-go-round turns. As it dips periodically through the galactic plane, \\nthe solar system may encounter large quantities of dust that disturb the Oort cloud, bring- \\ning down a hail of comets. \\n\\n\\n\\nBeyond the Future \\n\\n\\n299 \\n\\n\\nlong, will have long departed from the solar system. Unlike a supernova, \\nthere is ample warning of the demise of our sun. \\n\\nThe Death of the Galaxy \\n\\nOn a time scale of several billions of years, we must confront the fact \\nthat the Milky Way galaxy in which we live, will die. More precisely, we \\nlive on the Orion spiral arm of the Milky Way. When we gaze at the night \\nsky and feel dwarfed by the immensity of the celestial lights dotting the \\nheavens, we are actually looking at a tiny portion of the stars located on \\nthe Orion arm. The millions of stars that have inspired both lovers and \\npoets for generations occupy only a tiny part of the Orion arm. The rest \\nof the 200 billion stars within the Milky Way are so distant that they can \\nbarely be seen as a hazy ribbon that cuts across the night sky. \\n\\nAbout 2 million light-years from the Milky Way is our nearest galactic \\nneighbor, the great Andromeda galaxy, which is two to three times larger \\nthan our own galaxy. The two galaxies are hurtling toward each other \\nat 125 kilometers per second, and should collide within 5 to 10 billion \\nyears. As astronomer Lars Hernquist at the University of California at \\nSanta Cruz has said, this collision will be \"analogous to a hostile take- \\nover. Our galaxy will be consumed and destroyed.\\'\" \\n\\nAs seen from outer space, the Andromeda galaxy will appear to col- \\nlide with and then slowly absorb the Milky Way galaxy. Computer sim- \\nulations of colliding galaxies show that the gravitational pull of the larger \\ngalaxy will slowly overwhelm the gravity of the smaller galaxy, and after \\nseveral rotations the smaller galaxy will be eaten up. But because the \\nstars within the Milky Way galaxy are so widely separated by the vacuum \\nof space, the number of collisions between stars will be quite low. on the \\norder of several collisions per century. So our sun may avoid a direct \\ncollision for an extended period of time. \\n\\nUltimately, on this time scale of billions of years, we have a much \\nmore deadly fate, the death of the universe itself. Clever forms of intel- \\nligent life may find ways to build space arks to avoid most natural catas- \\ntrophes, but how can we avoid the death of the universe, when space \\nitself is our worst enemy? \\n\\nThe Aztecs believed that the end of the world would come when the \\nsun one day falls from the sky. They foretold that this would come \"when \\nthe Earth has become tired .... when the seed of Earth has ended.\" \\nThe stars would be shaken from the heavens. \\n\\nPerhaps they were close to the truth. \\n\\nOne can hope that by the time our sun begins to flicker out, human- \\n\\n\\n\\n300 \\n\\n\\nMASTERS OF HYPERSPACE \\n\\n\\nity will have long since left the solar system and reached for the stars. \\n(In fact, in Asimov\\'s Foundation series, the location of our original star \\nsystem has been lost for thousands ofyears.) However, inevitably, all the \\nstars in the heavens will flicker out as their nuclear fuel is exhausted. \\nOn a scale of tens to hundreds of billions of years, we are facing the \\ndeath of the universe itself. Either the universe is open, in which case it \\nwill expand forever until temperatures gradually reach near absolute \\nzero, or the universe is closed, in which case the expansion will be \\nreversed and the universe will die in a fiery Big Crunch. Even for a Type \\nIII civilization, this is a daunting threat to its existence. Can mastery of \\nhyperspace save civilization from its ultimate catastrophe, the death of \\nthe universe? \\n\\n\\n\\n14 \\n\\n\\nThe Fate of the Universe \\n\\n\\nSome say the world will end in fire. \\nSome say in ice. \\n\\nFrom what I\\'ve tasted of desire \\nI hold with those who favor fire. \\n\\nRobert Frost \\n\\n\\nIt ain\\'t over \\'til it\\'s over. \\n\\nYogi Berra \\n\\n\\nW HETHER a civilization, either on earth or in outer space, can \\nreach a point in its technological development to harness the \\npower of hyperspace depends partly, as we have seen, on negotiating a \\nseries of disasters typical of Type 0 civilizations. The danger period is \\nthe first several hundred years after the dawn of the nuclear age, when \\na civilization\\'s technological development has far outpaced its social and \\npolitical maturity in handling regional conflicts. \\n\\nBy the time a civilization has attained Type III status, it will have \\nachieved a planetary social structure advanced enough to avoid self-anni- \\nhilation and a technology powerful enough to avoid an ecological or a \\nnatural disaster, such as an ice age or solar collapse. However, even a \\nType III civilization will have difficulty avoiding the ultimate catastrophe: \\nthe death of the universe itself. Even the mightiest and most sophisti- \\ncated of the Type III civilization\\'s starships will be unable to escape the \\nfinal destiny of the universe. \\n\\nThat the universe itself must die was known to nineteenth-century \\n\\n\\n301 \\n\\n\\n\\n302 \\n\\n\\nMASTERS OF HYPERSPACE \\n\\n\\nscientists. Charles Darwin, in his Autobiography, wrote of his anguish when \\nhe realized this profound but depressing fact: \"Believing as I do that \\nman in the distant future will be a far more perfect creature than he \\nnow is, it is an intolerable thought that he and all other sentient beings \\nare doomed to complete annihilation after such long-continued slow \\nprogress.\\'\" \\n\\nThe mathematician and philosopher Bertrand Russell wrote that the \\nultimate extinction of humanity is a cause of \"unyielding despair.\" In \\nwhat must be one of the most depressing passages ever written by a \\nscientist, Russell noted: \\n\\n\\nThat man is the product of causes which had no prevision of the end they \\nwere achieving; that his origin, his growth, his hopes and fears, his loves \\nand his beliefs, are but the outcome of accidental collocations of atoms; \\nthat no fire, no heroism, no intensity of thought or feeling, can preserve \\na life beyond the grave; that all the labors of the ages, all the devotion, all \\nthe inspiration, all the noonday brightness of human genius, are destined \\nto extinction in the vast death of the solar system; and the whole temple \\nof Man\\'s achievement must inevitably be buried beneath the debris of a \\nuniverse in ruins \\xe2\\x80\\x94 all these things, if not quite beyond dispute, are yet so \\nnearly certain, that no philosophy which rejects them can hope to stand. \\nOnly within the scaffolding of these truths, only on the firm foundation \\nof unyielding despair, can the soul\\'s habitation be safely built . 2 \\n\\n\\nRussell wrote this passage in 1923, decades before the advent of space \\ntravel. The death of the solar system loomed large in his mind, a rigorous \\nconclusion of the laws of physics. Within the confines of the limited \\ntechnology of his time, this depressing conclusion seemed inescapable. \\nSince that time, we have learned enough about stellar evolution to know \\nthat our sun will eventually become a red giant and consume the earth \\nin nuclear fire. However, we also understand the basics of space travel. \\nIn Russell\\'s time, the very thought of large ships capable of placing \\nhumans on the moon or the planets was universally considered to be \\nthe thinking of a madman. However, with the exponential growth of \\ntechnology, the prospect of the death of the solar system is not such a \\nfearsome event for humanity, as we have seen. By the time our sun turns \\ninto a red giant, humanity either will have long perished into nuclear \\ndust or, hopefully, will have found its rightful place among the stars. \\n\\nStill, it is a simple matter to generalize Russell\\'s \"unyielding despair\" \\nfrom the death of our solar system to the death of the entire universe. \\nIn that event, it appears that no space ark can transport humanity out \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Fate of the Universe \\n\\n\\n303 \\n\\n\\nof harm\\'s way. The conclusion seems irrefutable; physics predicts that \\nall intelligent life forms, no matter how advanced, will eventually perish \\nwhen the universe itself dies. \\n\\nAccording to Einstein\\'s general theory of relativity, the universe \\neither will continue to expand forever in a Cosmic Whimper, in which \\ncase the universe reaches near absolute zero temperatures, or will con- \\ntract into a fiery collapse, the Big Crunch. The universe will die either \\nin \"ice,\" with an open universe, or in \"fire,\" with a closed universe. \\nEither way, a Type III civilization is doomed because temperatures will \\napproach either absolute zero or infinity. \\n\\nTo tell which fate awaits us, cosmologists use Einstein\\'s equations to \\ncalculate the total amount of matter-energy in the universe. Because the \\nmatter in Einstein\\'s equation determines the amount of space-time cur- \\nvature, we must know the average matter density of the universe in order \\nto determine if there is enough matter and energy for gravitation to \\nreverse the cosmic expansion of the original Big Bang. \\n\\nA critical value for the average matter density determines the ulti- \\nmate fate of the universe and all intelligent life within it. If the average \\ndensity of the universe is less than 10 \" gram per cubic centimeter, \\nwhich amounts to 10 milligrams of matter spread over the volume of the \\nearth, then the universe will continue to expand forever, until it becomes \\na uniformly cold, lifeless space. However, if the average density is larger \\nthan this value, then there is enough matter for the gravitational force \\nof the universe to reverse the Big Bang, and suffer the fiery temperatures \\nof the Big Crunch. \\n\\nAt present, the experimental situation is confused. Astronomers have \\nseveral ways of measuring the mass of a galaxy, and hence the mass of \\nthe universe. The first is to count the number of stars in a galaxy, and \\nmultiply that number by the average weight of each star. Calculations \\nperformed in this tedious fashion show that the average density is less \\nthan the critical amount, and that the universe will continue to expand \\nforever. The problem with this calculation is that it omits matter that is \\nnot luminous (for example, dust clouds, black holes, cold dwarf stars). \\n\\nThere is also a second way to perform this calculation, which is to \\nuse Newton\\'s laws. By calculating the time it takes for stars to move \\naround a galaxy, astronomers can use Newton\\'s laws to estimate the total \\nmass of the galaxy, in the same way that Newton used the time it took \\nfor the moon to orbit the earth to estimate the mass of the moon and \\nearth. \\n\\nThe problem is the mismatch between these two calculations. In fact, \\nastronomers know that up to 90% of the mass of a galaxy is in the form \\n\\n\\n\\n304 \\n\\n\\nMASTERS OF HYPERSPACE \\n\\n\\nof hidden, undetectable \"missing mass\" or \"dark matter,\" which is not \\nluminous but has weight. Even if we include an approximate value for \\nthe mass of nonluminous interstellar gas, Newton\\'s laws predict that the \\ngalaxy is far heavier than the value calculated by counting stars. \\n\\nUntil astronomers resolve the question of this missing mass or dark \\nmatter, we cannot resolve the question of whether the universe will con- \\ntract and collapse into a fiery ball or will expand forever. \\n\\n\\nEntropy Death \\n\\nAssume, for the moment, that the average density of the universe is less \\nthan the critical value. Since the matter-energy content determines the \\ncurvature of space-time, we find that there is not enough matter-energy \\nto make the universe recollapse. It will then expand limitlessly until its \\ntemperature reaches almost absolute zero. This increases entropy (which \\nmeasures the total amount of chaos or randomness in the universe). \\nEventually, the universe dies in an entropy death. \\n\\nThe English physicist and astronomer Sir James Jeans wrote about \\nthe ultimate death of the universe, which he called the \"heat death,\" as \\nearly as the turn of the century: \"The second law of thermodynamics \\npredicts that there can be but one end to the universe \\xe2\\x80\\x94 a \\'heat death\\' \\nin which [the] temperature is so low as to make life impossible.\"\\' \\n\\nTo understand how entropy death occurs, it is important to under- \\nstand the three laws of thermodynamics, which govern all chemical and \\nnuclear processes on the earth and in the stars. The British scientist and \\nauthor C. P. Snow had an elegant way of remembering the three laws: \\n\\n1. You cannot win (that is, you cannot get something for nothing, \\nbecause matter and energy are conserved). \\n\\n2. You cannot break even (you cannot return to the same energy \\nstate, because there is always an increase in disorder; entropy \\nalways increases). \\n\\n3. You cannot get out of the game (because absolute zero is unattain- \\nable). \\n\\nFor the death of the universe, the most important is the Second Law, \\nwhich states that any process creates a net increase in the amount of \\ndisorder (entropy) in the universe. The Second Law is actually an inte- \\ngral part of our everyday lives. For example, consider pouring cream \\ninto a cup of coffee. Order (separate cups of cream and coffee) has \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Fate of the Universe \\n\\n\\n305 \\n\\n\\nnaturally changed into disorder (a random mixture of cream and cof- \\nfee). However, reversing entropy, extracting order from disorder, is \\nexceedingly difficult. \"Unmixing\" the liquid back into separate cups of \\ncream and coffee is impossible without an elaborate chemistry labora- \\ntory. Also, a lighted cigarette can fill an empty room with wisps of smoke, \\nincreasing entropy in that room. Order (tobacco and paper) has again \\nturned into disorder (smoke and charcoal). Reversing entropy \\xe2\\x80\\x94 that is, \\nforcing the smoke back into the cigarette and turning the charcoal back \\ninto unburned tobacco \\xe2\\x80\\x94 is impossible even with the finest chemistry \\nlaboratory on the planet. \\n\\nSimilarly, everyone knows that it\\'s easier to destroy than to build. It \\nmay take a year to construct a house, but only an hour or so to destroy \\nit in a fire. It took almost 5,000 years to transform roving bands of hunt- \\ners into the great Aztec civilization, which flourished over Mexico and \\nCentral America and built towering monuments to its gods. However, it \\nonly took a few months for Cortez and the conquistadors to demolish \\nthat civilization. \\n\\nEntropy is relentlessly increasing in the stars as well as on our planet. \\nEventually, this means that the stars will exhaust their nuclear fuel and \\ndie, turning into dead masses of nuclear matter. The universe will \\ndarken as the stars, one by one, cease to twinkle. \\n\\nGiven our understanding of stellar evolution, we can paint a rather \\ndismal picture of how the universe will die. All stars will become black \\nholes, neutron stars, or cold dwarf stars (depending on their mass) \\nwithin 10\" years as their nuclear furnaces shut down. Entropy increases \\nas stars slide down the curve of binding energy, until no more energy \\ncan be extracted by fusing their nuclear fuel. Within 10\" years, all pro- \\ntons and neutrons in the universe will probably decay. According to the \\nGUTs, the protons and neutrons are unstable over that vast time scale. \\nThis means that eventually all matter as we know it, including the earth \\nand the solar system, will dissolve into smaller particles, such as electrons \\nand neutrinos. Thus intelligent beings will have to face the unpleasant \\npossibility that the protons and neutrons in their bodies will disintegrate. \\nThe bodies of intelligent organisms will no longer be made of the famil- \\niar 100 chemical elements, which are unstable over that immense period \\nof time. Intelligent life will have to find ways of creating new bodies made \\nof energy, electrons, and neutrinos. \\n\\nAfter a fantastic 10 \\xe2\\x84\\xa2 (a googol) years, the universe\\'s temperature \\nwill reach near absolute zero. Intelligent life in this dismal future will \\nface the prospect of extinction. Unable to huddle next to stars, they will \\nfreeze to death. But even in a desolate, cold universe at temperatures \\n\\n\\n\\n306 \\n\\n\\nMASTERS OF HYPERSPACE \\n\\n\\nnear absolute zero, there is one last remaining flickering source of \\nenergy: black holes. According to cosmologist Stephen Hawking, black \\nholes are not completely black, but slowly leak energy into outer space \\nover an extended period of time. \\n\\nIn this distant future, black holes may become \"life preservers\" \\nbecause they slowly evaporate energy. Intelligent life would necessarily \\ncongregate next to these black holes and extract energy from them to \\nkeep their machines functioning. Intelligent civilizations, like shivering \\nhomeless people huddled next to a fading fire, would be reduced to \\npathetic outposts of misery clinging to a black hole. 4 \\n\\nButwhat, we may ask, happens after 10 years, when the evaporating \\n\\nblack holes will have exhausted most of their own energy? Astronomers \\nJohn D. Barrow of the University of Sussex and Joseph Silk of the Uni- \\nversity of California at Berkeley caution that this question may ultimately \\nhave no answer with present-day knowledge. On that time scale, quan- \\ntum theory, for example, leaves open the possibility that our universe \\nmay \"tunnel\" into another universe. \\n\\nThe probabilities for these kinds of events are exceedingly small; one \\nwould have to wait a time interval larger than the lifetime of our present \\nuniverse, so we need not worry that reality will suddenly collapse in our \\nlifetime, bringing with it a new set of physical laws. However, on the scale \\nof 10 \"\\xe2\\x80\\x9d years, these kinds of rare cosmic quantum events can no longer \\nbe ruled out. \\n\\nBarrow and Silk add. \"Where there is quantum theory there is hope. \\nWe can never be completely sure this cosmic heat death will occur \\nbecause we can never predict the future of a quantum mechanical uni- \\nverse with complete certainty; for in an infinite quantum future anything \\nthat can happen, eventually will.\" 5 \\n\\n\\nEscape Through a Higher Dimension \\n\\nThe Cosmic Whimper is indeed a dismal fate awaiting us if the average \\ndensity of the universe is too low. Now assume that the average density \\nis larger than the critical value. This means that the expansion process \\nwill contract within tens of billions of years, and the universe will end in \\nfire, not ice. \\n\\nIn this scenario, there is enough matter and hence a strong enough \\ngravitational pull in the universe to halt the expansion, and then the \\nuniverse will begin to slowly recollapse, bringing the distant galaxies \\ntogether again. Starlight will become \"blue shifted,\" instead of red \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Fate of the Universe \\n\\n\\n307 \\n\\n\\nshifted, indicating that the stars are rapidly approaching one another. \\nThe temperatures once again will rise to astronomical limits. Eventually, \\nthe heat will become sufficiently great to vaporize all matter into a gas. \\n\\nIntelligent beings will find that their planets\\' oceans have boiled away \\nand that their atmospheres have turned into a searing furnace. As their \\nplanets begin to disintegrate, they will be forced to flee into outer space \\nin giant rockets. \\n\\nEven the sanctuary of outer space may prove to be inhospitable, how- \\never. Temperatures will eventually rise past the point where atoms are \\nstable, and electrons will be ripped off their nuclei, creating a plasma \\n(like that found in our sun). At this point, intelligent life may have to \\nbuild gigantic shields around their ships and use their entire energy \\noutput to keep their shields from disintegrating from the intense heat. \\n\\nAs temperatures continue to rise, the protons and neutrons in the \\nnucleus will be ripped apart. Eventually, the protons and neutrons them- \\nselves will be torn apart into quarks. As in a black hole, the Big Crunch \\ndevours everything. Nothing survives it. Thus it seems impossible that \\nordinary matter, let alone intelligent life, can survive the violent disrup- \\ntion. \\n\\nHowever, there is one possible escape. If all of space-time is collaps- \\ning into a fiery cataclysm, then the only way to escape the Big Crunch is \\nto leave space and time \\xe2\\x80\\x94 escape via hyperspace. This may not be as far- \\nfetched as it sounds. Computer calculations performed with Kaluza- \\nKlein and superstring theories have shown that moments after Creation, \\nthe four-dimensional universe expanded at the expense of the six- \\ndimensional universe. Thus the ultimate fate of the four- and the six- \\ndimensional universes are linked. \\n\\nAssuming that this basic picture is correct, our six-dimensional twin \\nuniverse may gradually expand, as our own four-dimensional universe \\ncollapses. Moments before our universe shrinks to nothing, intelligent \\nlife may realize that the six-dimensional universe is opening up, and find \\na means to exploit that fact. \\n\\nInterdimensional travel is impossible today because our sister uni- \\nverse has shrunk down to the Planck scale. However, in the final stages \\nof a collapse, the sister universe may open up, making dimensional travel \\npossible once again. If the sister universe expands enough, then matter \\nand energy may escape into it, making an escape hatch possible for any \\nintelligent beings smart enough to calculate the dynamics of space-time. \\n\\nThe late Columbia University physicist Gerald Feinberg speculated \\non this long shot of escaping the ultimate compression of the universe \\nthrough extra dimensions: \\n\\n\\n\\n308 \\n\\n\\nMASTERS OF HYPERSPACE \\n\\n\\nAt present, this is no more than a science fiction plot. However, if there \\nare more dimensions than those we know, or four-dimensional space- \\ntimes in addition to the one we inhabit, then I think it very likely that there \\nare physical phenomena that provide connections between them. It seems \\nplausible that if intelligence persists in the universe, it will, in much less \\ntime than the many billions of years before the Big Crunch, find out \\nwhether there is anything to this speculation, and if so how to take advan- \\ntage of it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\n\\n\\nColonizing the Universe \\n\\nAlmost all scientists who have investigated the death of the universe, \\nfrom Bertrand Russell to current cosmologists, have assumed that intel- \\nligent life will be almost helpless in the face of the inevitable, final death \\nthroes of the universe. Even the theory that intelligent beings can tunnel \\nthrough hyperspace and avoid the Big Crunch assumes that these beings \\nare passive victims until the final moments of the collapse. \\n\\nHowever, physicists John D. Barrow of the University of Sussex and \\nFrankJ. Tipler ofTulane University, in their book The Anthropic Cosmo- \\nlogical Principle, have departed from conventional wisdom and concluded \\njust the opposite: that intelligent life, over billions of years of evolution, \\nwill play an active role in the final moments of our universe. They take \\nthe rather unorthodox view that technology will continue to rise expo- \\nnentially over billions of years, constantly accelerating in proportion to \\nexisting technology. The more star systems that intelligent beings have \\ncolonized, the more star systems they can colonize. Barrow and Tipler \\nargue that over several billion years, intelligent beings will have com- \\npletely colonized vast portions of the visible universe. But they are con- \\nservative; they do not assume that intelligent life will have mastered the \\nart of hyperspace travel. They assume only that their rockets will travel \\nat near-light velocities. \\n\\nThis scenario should be taken seriously for several reasons. First, \\nrockets traveling at near-light velocities (propelled, say, by photon \\nengines using the power of large laser beams) may take hundreds of \\nyears to reach distant star systems. But Barrow and Tipler believe that \\nintelligent beings will thrive for billions of years, which is sufficient time \\nto colonize their own and neighboring galaxies even with sub-light-speed \\nrockets. \\n\\nWithout assuming hyperspace travel, Barrow and Tipler argue that \\nintelligent beings will send millions of small \"von Neumann probes\" \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Fate of the Universe \\n\\n\\n309 \\n\\n\\ninto the galaxy at near-light speeds to find suitable star systems for col- \\nonization. John von Neumann, the mathematical genius who developed \\nthe first electronic computer at Princeton University during World War \\nII, proved rigorously that robots or automatons could be built with the \\nability to program themselves, repair themselves, and even create carbon \\ncopies of themselves. Thus Barrow and Tipler suggest that the von Neu- \\nmann probes will function largely independently of their creators. These \\nsmall probes will be vastly different from the current generation of Viking \\nand Pioneer probes, which are little more than passive, preprogrammed \\nmachines obeying orders from their human masters. The von Neumann \\nprobes will be similar to Dyson\\'s Astrochicken, except vastly more pow- \\nerful and intelligent. They will enter new star systems, land on planets, \\nand mine the rock for suitable chemicals and metals. They will then \\ncreate a small industrial complex capable of manufacturing numerous \\nrobotic copies of themselves. From these bases, more von Neumann \\nprobes will be launched to explore even more star systems. \\n\\nBeing self-programming automatons, these probes will not need \\ninstructions from their mother planet; they will explore millions of star \\nsystems entirely on their own, pausing only to periodically radio back \\ntheir findings. With millions of these von Neumann probes scattered \\nthroughout the galaxy, creating millions of copies of themselves as they \\n\"eat\" and \"digest\" the chemicals on each planet, an intelligent civili- \\nzation will be able to cut down the time wasted exploring uninteresting \\nstar systems. (Barrow and Tipler even consider the possibility that von \\nNeumann probes from distant civilizations have already entered our own \\nsolar system. Perhaps the monolith featured so mysteriously in 2001: A \\nSpace Odyssey was a von Neumann probe.) \\n\\nIn the \"Star Trek\" series, for example, the exploration of other star \\nsystems by the Federation is rather primitive. The exploration process \\ndepends totally on the skills of humans aboard a small number of star- \\nships. Although this scenario may make for intriguing human-interest \\ndramas, it is a highly inefficient method of stellar exploration, given the \\nlarge number of planetary systems that are probably unsuitable for life. \\nVon Neumann probes, although they may not have the interesting \\nadventures of Captain Kirk or Captain Picard and their crews, would be \\nmore suitable for galactic exploration. \\n\\nBarrow and Tipler make a second assumption that is crucial to their \\nargument: The expansion of the universe will eventually slow down and \\nreverse itself over tens of billions ofyears. During the contraction phase \\nof the universe, the distance between galaxies will decrease, making it \\nvastly easier for intelligent beings to continue the colonization of the \\n\\n\\n\\n310 \\n\\n\\nMASTERS OF HYPERSPACE \\n\\n\\ngalaxies. As the contraction of the universe accelerates, the rate of col- \\nonization of neighboring galaxies will also accelerate, until the entire \\nuniverse is eventually colonized. \\n\\nEven though Barrow and Tipler assume that intelligent life will pop- \\nulate the entire universe, they are still at a loss to explain how any life \\nform will be able to withstand the unbelievably large temperatures and \\npressures created by the final collapse of the universe. They concede \\nthat the heat created by the contraction phase will be great enough to \\nvaporize any living being, but perhaps the robots that they have created \\nwill be sufficiently heat resistant to withstand the final moments of the \\ncollapse. \\n\\n\\nRe-Creating the Big Bang \\n\\nAlong these lines, Isaac Asimov has conjectured how intelligent beings \\nmight react to the final death of the universe. In \"The Last Question,\" \\nAsimov asks the ancient question ofwhether the universe must inevitably \\ndie, and what will happen to all intelligent life when we reach Doomsday. \\nAsimov, however, assumes that the universe will die in ice, rather than \\nin fire, as the stars cease to burn hydrogen and temperatures plummet \\nto absolute zero. \\n\\nThe story begins in the year 2061, when a colossal computer has \\nsolved the earth\\'s energy problems by designing a massive solar satellite \\nin space that can beam the sun\\'s energy back to earth. The AC (analog \\ncomputer) is so large and advanced that its technicians have only the \\nvaguest idea of how it operates. On a $5 bet, two drunken technicians \\nask the computer whether the sun\\'s eventual death can be avoided or, \\nfor that matter, whether the universe must inevitably die. After quietly \\nmulling over this question, the AC responds: INSUFFICIENT DATA FORA \\nMEANINGFUL ANSWER. \\n\\nCenturies into the future, the AC has solved the problem of hyper- \\nspace travel, and humans begin colonizing thousands of star systems. \\nThe AC is so large that it occupies several hundred square miles on each \\nplanet and so complex that it maintains and services itself. A young \\nfamily is rocketing through hyperspace, unerringly guided by the AC, in \\nsearch of a new star system to colonize. When the father casually men- \\ntions that the stars must eventually die, the children become hysterical. \\n\"Don\\'t let the stars die,\" plead the children. To calm the children, he \\nasks the AC if entropy can be reversed. \"See,\" reassures the father, read- \\ning the AC\\'s response, the AC can solve everything. He comforts them \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Fate of the Universe \\n\\n\\n311 \\n\\n\\nby saying, \"It will take care of everything when the time comes, so don\\'t \\nworry.\" He never tells the children that the AC actually prints out: INSUF- \\nFICIENT DATA FOR A MEANINGFUL ANSWER. \\n\\nThousands of years into the future, the Galaxy itself has been colo- \\nnized. The AC has solved the problem of immortality and harnesses the \\nenergy of the Galaxy, but must find new galaxies for colonization. The \\nAC is so complex that it is long past the point where anyone understands \\nhow it works. It continually redesigns and improves its own circuits. Two \\nmembers of the Galactic Council, each hundreds of years old, debate \\nthe urgent question of finding new galactic energy sources, and wonder \\nif the universe itself is running down. Can entropy be reversed? they ask. \\nThe AC responds: INSUFFICIENT DATA FORA MEANINGFUL ANSWER. \\n\\nMillions of years into the future, humanity has spread across the \\nuncountable galaxies of the universe. The AC has solved the problem \\nof releasing the mind from the body, and human minds are free to \\nexplore the vastness ofmillions of galaxies, with their bodies safely stored \\non some long forgotten planet. Two minds accidentally meet each other \\nin outer space, and casually wonder where among the uncountable gal- \\naxies humans originated. The AC, which is now so large that most of it \\nhas to be housed in hyperspace, responds by instantly transporting them \\nto an obscure galaxy. They are disappointed. The galaxy is so ordinary, \\nlike millions of other galaxies, and the original star has long since died. \\nThe two minds become anxious because billions of stars in the heavens \\nare slowly meeting the same fate. The two minds ask, can the death of \\nthe universe itselfbe avoided? From hyperspace, the AC responds: INSUF- \\nFICIENT DATA FOR A MEANINGFUL ANSWER. \\n\\nBillions of years into the future, humanity consists of a trillion, tril- \\nlion, trillion immortal bodies, each cared for by automatons. Humanity\\'s \\ncollective mind, which is free to roam anywhere in the universe at will, \\neventually fuses into a single mind, which in turn fuses with the AC itself. \\nIt no longer makes sense to ask what the AC is made of, or where in \\nhyperspace it really is. \"The universe is dying,\" thinks Man, collectively. \\nOne by one, as the stars and galaxies cease to generate energy, temper- \\natures throughout the universe approach absolute zero. Man desperately \\nasks if the cold and darkness slowly engulfing the galaxies mean its even- \\ntual death. From hyperspace, the AC answers: INSUFFICIENT DATA FOR A \\nMEANINGFUL ANSWER. \\n\\nWhen Man asks the AC to collect the necessary data, it responds: I \\nWILL DO SO. I HAVE BEEN DOING SO FOR A HUNDRED BILLION YEARS. MY PRED- \\nECESSORS HAVE BEEN ASKED THIS QUESTION MANY TIMES. ALL THE DATA I \\nHAVE REMAINS INSUFFICIENT. \\n\\n\\n\\n312 \\n\\n\\nMASTERS OF HYPERSPACE \\n\\n\\nA timeless interval passes, and the universe has finally reached its \\nultimate death. From hyperspace, the AC spends an eternity collecting \\ndata and contemplating the final question. At last, the AC discovers the \\nsolution, even though there is no longer anyone to give the answer. The \\nAC carefully formulates a program, and then begins the process of \\nreversing Chaos. It collects cold, interstellar gas, brings together the \\ndead stars, until a gigantic ball is created. \\n\\nThen, when its labors are done, from hyperspace the AC thunders: \\n\\nLET THERE BE LIGHT! \\n\\nAnd there was light \\xe2\\x80\\x94 \\n\\nAnd on the seventh day, He rested. \\n\\n\\n\\n15 \\n\\nConclusion \\n\\n\\nThe known is finite, the unknown infinite; intellectually we \\nstand on an islet in the midst of an illimitable ocean ofinexpl- \\nicability. Our business in every generation is to reclaim a little \\nmore land. \\n\\nThomas H. Huxley \\n\\n\\nP ERHAPS the most profound discovery of the past century in physics \\nhas been the realization that nature, at its most fundamental level, \\nis simpler than anyone thought. Although the mathematical complexity \\nof the ten-dimensional theory has soared to dizzying heights, opening \\nup new areas of mathematics in the process, the basic concepts driving \\nunification forward, such as higher-dimensional space and strings, are \\nbasically simple and geometric. \\n\\nAlthough it is too early to tell, future historians of science, when \\nlooking back at the tumultuous twentieth century, may view one of the \\ngreat conceptual revolutions to be the introduction of higher-dimen- \\nsional space-time theories, such as superstring and Kaluza-Klein-type \\ntheories. As Copernicus simplified the solar system with his series of \\nconcentric circles and dethroned the central role of the earth in the \\nheavens, the ten-dimensional theory promises to vastly simplify the laws \\nof nature and dethrone the familiar world of three dimensions. As we \\nhave seen, the crucial realization is that a three-dimensional description \\nof the world, such as the Standard Model, is \"too small\" to unite all the \\nfundamental forces of nature into one comprehensive theory. Jamming \\n\\n\\n313 \\n\\n\\n\\n314 \\n\\n\\nMASTERS OF HYPERSPACE \\n\\n\\nthe four fundamental forces into a three-dimensional theory creates an \\nugly, contrived, and ultimately incorrect description of nature. \\n\\nThus the main current dominating theoretical physics in the past \\ndecade has been the realization that the fundamental laws of physics \\nappear simpler in higher dimensions, and that all physical laws appear \\nto be unified in ten dimensions. These theories allow us to reduce an \\nenormous amount of information into a concise, elegant fashion that \\nunites the two greatest theories of the twentieth century: quantum theory \\nand general relativity. Perhaps it is time to explore some of the many \\nimplications that the ten-dimensional theory has for the future ofphysics \\nand science, the debate between reductionism and holism in nature, \\nand the aesthetic relation among physics, mathematics, religion, and \\nphilosophy. \\n\\n\\nTen Dimensions and Experiment \\n\\nWhen caught up in the excitement and turmoil accompanying the birth \\nof any great theory, there is a tendency to forget that ultimately all the- \\nories must be tested against the bedrock of experiment. No matter how \\nelegant or beautiful a theory may appear, it is doomed if it disagrees \\nwith reality. \\n\\nGoethe once wrote, \"Gray is the dogma, but green is the tree of life.\" \\nHistory has repeatedly borne out the correctness of his pungent obser- \\nvation. There are many examples of old, incorrect theories that stub- \\nbornly persisted for years, sustained only by the prestige of foolish but \\nwell-connected scientists. At times, it even became politically risky to \\noppose the power of ossified, senior scientists. Many of these theories \\nhave been killed off only when some decisive experiment exposed their \\nincorrectness. \\n\\nFor example, because of Hermann von Helmholtz\\'s fame and con- \\nsiderable influence in nineteenth-century Germany, his theory of elec- \\ntromagnetism was much more popular among scientists than Maxwell\\'s \\nrelatively obscure theory. But no matter how well known Helmholtz was, \\nultimately experiment confirmed the theory of Maxwell and relegated \\nHelmholtz\\'s theory to obscurity. Similarly, when Einstein proposed his \\ntheory of relativity, many politically powerful scientists in Nazi Germany, \\nlike Nobel laureate Philip Lenard, hounded him until he was driven out \\nof Berlin in 1933. Thus the yeoman\\'s work in any science, and especially \\nphysics, is done by the experimentalist, who must keep the theoreticians \\nhonest. \\n\\n\\n\\nConclusion \\n\\n\\n315 \\n\\n\\nVictor Weisskopf. a theoretical physicist at MIT, once summarized \\nthe relationship between theoretical and experimental science when he \\nobserved that there are three kinds of physicists: the machine builders \\n(who build the atom smashers that make the experiment possible), the \\nexperimentalists (who plan and execute the experiment), and the the- \\noreticians (who devise the theory to explain the experiment). He then \\ncompared these three classes to Columbus\\'s voyage to America. He \\nobserved that \\n\\nthe machine builders correspond to the captains and ship builders who \\nreally developed the techniques at that time. The experimentalists were \\nthose fellows on the ships that sailed to the other side of the world and \\nthen jumped upon the new islands and just wrote down what they saw. \\nThe theoretical physicists are those fellows who stayed back in Madrid and \\ntold Columbus that he was going to land in India.\\' \\n\\nIf. however, the laws of physics become united in ten dimensions \\nonly at energies far beyond anything available with our present tech- \\nnology, then the future of experimental physics is in jeopardy. In the \\npast, every new generation of atom smashers has brought forth a new \\ngeneration of theories. This period may be coming to a close. \\n\\nAlthough everyone expected new surprises if the SSC became oper- \\national by about the year 2000, some were betting that it would simply \\nreconfirm the correctness of our present-day Standard Model. Most \\nlikely, the decisive experiments that will prove or disprove the correct- \\nness of the ten-dimensional theory cannot be performed anytime in the \\nnear future. We may be entering a long dry spell where research in ten- \\ndimensional theories will become an exercise in pure mathematics. All \\ntheories derive their power and strength from experiment, which is like \\nfertile soil that can nourish and sustain a field of flowering plants once \\nthey take root. If the soil becomes barren and dry, then the plants will \\nwither along with it. \\n\\nDavid Gross, one of the originators of the heterotic string theory, has \\ncompared the development of physics to the relationship between two \\nmountain climbers: \\n\\nIt used to be that as we were climbing the mountain ofnature, the exper- \\nimentalists would lead the way. We lazy theorists would lag behind. Every \\nonce in a while they would kick down an experimental stone which would \\nbounce off our heads. Eventually we would get the idea and we would \\nfollow the path that was broken by the experimentalists... . But now we \\ntheorists might have to take the lead. This is a much more lonely enter- \\n\\n\\n\\n316 \\n\\n\\nMASTERS OF HYPERSPACE \\n\\n\\nprise. In the past we always knew where the experimentalists were and thus \\nwhat we should aim for. Now we have no idea how large the mountain is, \\nnor where the summit is. \\n\\nAlthough experimentalists have traditionally taken the lead in break- \\ning open new territory, the next era in physics may be an exceptionally \\ndifficult one, forcing theoreticians to assume the lead, as Gross \\nnotes. \\n\\nThe SSC probably would have found new particles. The Higgs par- \\nticles may have been discovered, or \"super\" partners of the quarks may \\nhave shown up, or maybe a sublayer beneath the quarks may have been \\nrevealed. However, the basic forces binding these particles will, if the \\ntheory holds up, be the same. We may have seen more complex Yang- \\nMills fields and gluons coming forth from the SSC, but these fields may \\nrepresent only larger and larger symmetry groups, representing frag- \\nments of the even larger E(8) X E(8) symmetry coming from string \\ntheory. \\n\\nIn some sense, the origin of this uneasy relation between theory and \\nexperiment is due to the fact that this theory represents, as Witten has \\nnoted, \"21st century physics that fell accidentally into the 20th cen- \\ntury.\" Because the natural dialectic between theory and experiment was \\ndisrupted by the fortuitous accidental discovery of the theory in 1968, \\nperhaps we must wait until the twenty-first century, when we expect the \\narrival of new technologies that will hopefully open up a new generation \\nof atom smashers, cosmic-ray counters, and deep space probes. Perhaps \\nthis is the price we must pay for having a forbidden \"sneak preview\" \\ninto the physics of the next century. Perhaps by then, through indirect \\nmeans, we may experimentally see the glimmer of the tenth dimension \\nin our laboratories. \\n\\nTen Dimensions and Philosophy: Reductionism versus Holism \\n\\nAny great theory has equally great repercussions on technology and the \\nfoundations of philosophy. The birth of general relativity opened up \\nnew areas of research in astronomy and practically created the science \\nof cosmology. The philosophical implications of the Big Bang have sent \\nreverberations throughout the philosophical and theological commu- \\nnities. A few years ago, this even led to leading cosmologists having a \\nspecial audience with the pope at the Vatican to discuss the implications \\nof the Big Bang theory on the Bible and Genesis. \\n\\nSimilarly, quantum theory gave birth to the science of subatomic \\nparticles and helped fuel the current revolution in electronics. The tran- \\n\\n\\n\\nConclusion \\n\\n\\n317 \\n\\n\\nsistor \\xe2\\x80\\x94 the linchpin of modern technological society \\xe2\\x80\\x94 is a purely quan- \\ntum-mechanical device. Equally profound was the impact that the Hei- \\nsenberg Uncertainty Principle has had on the debate over free will and \\ndeterminism, affecting religious dogma on the role of sin and redemp- \\ntion for the church. Both the Catholic Church and the Presbyterian \\nChurch, with a large ideological stake in the outcome of this controversy \\nover predestination, have been affected by this debate over quantum \\nmechanics. Although the implications of the ten-dimensional theory are \\nstill unclear, we ultimately expect that the revolution now germinating \\nin the world of physics will have a similar far-reaching impact once the \\ntheory becomes accessible to the average person. \\n\\nIn general, however, most physicists feel uncomfortable talking about \\nphilosophy. They are supreme pragmatists. They stumble across physical \\nlaws not by design or ideology, but largely through trial and error and \\nshrewd guesses. The younger physicists, who do the lion\\'s share of \\nresearch, are too busy discovering new theories to waste time philoso- \\nphizing. Younger physicists, in fact, look askance at older physicists if \\nthey spend too much time sitting on distinguished policy committees or \\npontificating on the philosophy of science. \\n\\nMost physicists feel that, outside of vague notions of \"truth\" and \\n\"beauty,\" philosophy has no business intruding on their private domain. \\nIn general, they argue, reality has always proved to be much more sophis- \\nticated and subtle than any preconceived philosophy. They remind us \\nof some well-known figures in science who, in their waning years, took \\nup embarrassingly eccentric philosophical ideas that led down blind \\nalleys. \\n\\nWhen confronted with sticky philosophical questions, such as the \\nrole of \"consciousness\" in performing a quantum measurement, most \\nphysicists shrug their shoulders. As long as they can calculate the out- \\ncome of an experiment, they really don\\'t care about its philosophical \\nimplications. In fact, Richard Feynman almost made a career trying to \\nexpose the pompous pretenses of certain philosophers. The greater \\ntheir puffed-up rhetoric and erudite vocabulary, he thought, the weaker \\nthe scientific foundation of their arguments. (When debating the rela- \\ntive merits of physics and philosophy, I am sometimes reminded of the \\nnote written by an anonymous university president who analyzed the \\ndifferences between them. He wrote, \"Why is it that you physicists always \\nrequire so much expensive equipment? Now the Department of Math- \\nematics requires nothing but money for paper, pencils, and waste paper \\nbaskets and the Department of Philosophy is still better. It doesn\\'t even \\nask for waste paper baskets.\" 1 ) \\n\\nNevertheless, although the average physicist is not bothered by philo- \\n\\n\\n\\n318 \\n\\n\\nMASTERS OF HYPERSPACE \\n\\n\\nsophical questions, the greatest of them were. Einstein, Heisenberg, and \\nBohr spent long hours in heated discussions, wrestling late into the night \\nwith the meaning of measurement, the problems of consciousness, and \\nthe meaning of probability in their work. Thus it is legitimate to ask how \\nhigher-dimensional theories reflect on this philosophical conflict, espe- \\ncially regarding the debate between \"reductionism\" and \"holism.\" \\n\\nHeinz Pagels once said, \"We are passionate about our experience of \\nreality, and most of us project our hopes and fears onto the universe.\" 4 \\nThus it is inevitable that philosophical, even personal questions will \\nintrude into the discussion on higher-dimensional theories. Inevitably, \\nthe revival of higher dimensions in physics will rekindle the debate \\nbetween \"reductionism\" and \"holism\" that has flared, on and off, for \\nthe past decade. \\n\\nWebster\\'s Collegiate Dictionary defines reductionism as a \"procedure or \\ntheory that reduces complex data or phenomena to simple terms.\" This \\nhas been one of the guiding philosophies of subatomic physics \\xe2\\x80\\x94 to \\nreduce atoms and nuclei to their basic components. The phenomenal \\nexperimental success, for example, of the Standard Model in explaining \\nthe properties of hundreds of subatomic particles shows that there is \\nmerit in looking for the basic building blocks of matter. \\n\\nWebster\\'s Collegiate Dictionary defines holism as the \"theory that the \\ndetermining factors esp. in living nature are irreducible wholes.\" This \\nphilosophy maintains that the Western philosophy of breaking things \\ndown into their components is overly simplistic, that one misses the \\nlarger picture, which may contain vitally important information. For \\nexample, think of an ant colony containing thousands of ants that obeys \\ncomplex, dynamic rules of social behavior. The question is: What is the \\nbest way to understand the behavior of an ant colony? The reductionist \\nwould break the ants into their constituents: organic molecules. How- \\never, one may spend hundreds of years dissecting ants and analyzing \\ntheir molecular makeup without finding the simplest clues as to how an \\nant colony behaves. The obvious way is to analyze the behavior of an ant \\ncolony as an integral whole, without breaking it down. \\n\\nSimilarly, this debate has sparked considerable controversy within \\nthe area of brain research and artificial intelligence. The reductionist \\napproach is to reduce the brain to its ultimate units, the brain cells, and \\ntry to reassemble the brain from them. A whole school of research in \\nartificial intelligence held that by creating elemental digital circuits we \\ncould build up increasingly complex circuits, until we created artificial \\nintelligence. Although this school of thought had initial success in the \\n1950s by modeling \"intelligence\" along the lines of modern digital com- \\n\\n\\n\\nConclusion \\n\\n\\n319 \\n\\n\\nputers, it proved disappointing because it could not mimic even the \\nsimplest of brain functions, such as recognizing patterns in a photo- \\ngraph. \\n\\nThe second school of thought has tried to take a more holistic \\napproach to the brain. It attempts to define the functions of the brain \\nand create models that treat the brain as a whole. Although this has \\nproved more difficult to initiate, it holds great promise because certain \\nbrain functions that we take for granted (for example, tolerance of error, \\nweighing of uncertainty, and making creative associations between dif- \\nferent objects) are built into the system from the start. Neural network \\ntheory, for example, uses aspects of this organic approach. \\n\\nEach side of this reductionist-holistic debate takes a dim view of the \\nother. In their strenuous attempts to debunk each other, they sometimes \\nonly diminish themselves. They often talk past each other, not address- \\ning each other\\'s main points. \\n\\nThe latest twist in the debate is that the reductionists have, for the \\npast few years, declared victory over holism. Recently, there has been a \\nflurry of claims in the popular press by the reductionists that the suc- \\ncesses of the Standard Model and the GUT theory are vindications of \\nreducing nature to smaller and more basic constituents. By probing \\ndown to the elemental quarks, leptons, and Yang-Mills fields, physicists \\nhave finally isolated the basic constituents of all matter. For example, \\nphysicist James S. Trefil of the University of Virginia takes a swipe at \\nholism when he writes about the \"Triumph of Reductionism\" : \\n\\nDuring the 1960s and 1970s, when the complexity of the particle world \\nwas being made manifest in one experiment after another, some physicists \\nbroke faith with the reductionist philosophy and began to look outside of \\nthe Western tradition for guidance. In his book The Tao of Physics, for \\nexample, Fritjhof Capra argued that the philosophy of reductionism had \\nfailed and that it was time to take a more holistic, mystical view of \\nnature.. .. [T]he 1970s [however] can be thought of as the period in \\nwhich the great traditions ofWestern scientific thought, seemingly imper- \\niled by the advances of twentieth-century science, have been thoroughly \\nvindicated. Presumably, it will take a while for this realization to percolate \\naway from a small group of theoretical physicists and become incorporated \\ninto our general world view.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 \\n\\n\\nThe disciples of holism, however, turn this debate around. They \\nclaim that the idea of unification, perhaps the greatest theme in all of \\nphysics, is holistic, not reductionist. They point to how reductionists \\n\\n\\n\\n320 \\n\\n\\nMASTERS OF HYPERSPACE \\n\\n\\nwould sometimes snicker behind Einstein\\'s back in the last years of his \\nlife, saying that he was getting senile trying to unite all the forces of the \\nworld. The discovery of unifying patterns in physics was an idea pio- \\nneered by Einstein, not the reductionists. Furthermore, the inability of \\nthe reductionists to offer a convincing resolution of the Schrodinger\\'s \\ncat paradox shows that they have simply chosen to ignore the deeper, \\nphilosophical questions. The reductionists may have had great success \\nwith quantum field theory and the Standard Model, but ultimately that \\nsuccess is based on sand, because quantum theory, in the final analysis, \\nis an incomplete theory. \\n\\nBoth sides, of course, have merit. Each side is merely addressing \\ndifferent aspects of a difficult problem. However, taken to extremes, this \\ndebate sometimes degenerates into a battle between what I call bellig- \\nerent science versus know-nothing science. \\n\\nBelligerent science clubs the opposition with a heavy, rigid view of \\nscience that alienates rather than persuades. Belligerent science seeks \\nto win points in a debate, rather than win over the audience. Instead of \\nappealing to the finer instincts of the lay audience by presenting itself \\nas the defender of enlightened reason and sound experiment, it comes \\noff as a new Spanish Inquisition. Belligerent science is science with a \\nchip on its shoulder. Its scientists accuse the holists ofbeing soft-headed, \\nof getting their physics confused, of throwing pseudoscientific gibberish \\nto cover their ignorance. Thus belligerent science may be winning the \\nindividual battles, but is ultimately losing the war. In every one-on-one \\nskirmish, belligerent science may trounce the opposition by parading \\nout mountains of data and learned Ph.D.s. However, in the long run, \\narrogance and conceit may eventually backfire by alienating the very \\naudience that it is trying to persuade. \\n\\nKnow-nothing science goes to the opposite extreme, rejecting exper- \\niment and embracing whatever faddish philosophy happens to come \\nalong. Know-nothing science sees unpleasant facts as mere details, and \\nthe overall philosophy as everything. If the facts do not seem to fit the \\nphilosophy, then obviously something is wrong with the facts. Know- \\nnothing science comes in with a preformed agenda, based on personal \\nfulfillment rather than objective observation, and tries to fit in the sci- \\nence as an afterthought. \\n\\nThis split between these two factions first appeared during the Viet- \\nnam War, when the flower generation was appalled by the massive, exces- \\nsive use of deadly technology against a peasant nation. But perhaps the \\narea in which this legitimate debate has flared up most recently is per- \\nsonal health. For example, well-paid lobbyists for the powerful agri-busi- \\n\\n\\n\\nConclusion \\n\\n\\n321 \\n\\n\\nness and food industry in the 1950s and 1960s exerted considerable \\ninfluence on Congress and the medical establishment, preventing a \\nthorough examination of the harmful effects of cholesterol, tobacco, \\nanimal fats, pesticides, and certain food additives on heart disease and \\ncancer, which have now been thoroughly documented. \\n\\nA recent example is the scandal that surrounded the uproar over the \\npesticide Alar in apples. When the environmentalists at the National \\nResources Defense Council announced that current levels of pesticides \\nin apples could kill upward of 5,000 children, they sparked concern \\namong consumers and indignation within the food industry, which \\ndenounced them as alarmists. Then it was revealed that the report used \\nfigures and data from the federal government to arrive at these conclu- \\nsions. This, in turn, implied that the Food and Drug Administration was \\nsacrificing 5,000 children in the interests of \"acceptable risk.\" \\n\\nIn addition, the revelations about the widespread possible contami- \\nnation of our drinking water by lead, which can cause serious neurolog- \\nical problems in children, only served to lower the prestige of science \\nin the minds of most Americans. The medical profession, the food indus- \\ntry, and the chemical industry have begun to earn the distrust of wide \\nportions of society. These and other scandals have also contributed to \\nthe national flareup of faddish health diets, most ofwhich are well inten- \\ntioned, but some of which are not scientifically sound. \\n\\n\\nHigher Synthesis in Higher Dimensions \\n\\nThese two philosophical viewpoints, apparently irreconcilable, must be \\nviewed from the larger perspective. They are antagonistic only when \\nviewed in their extreme form. \\n\\nPerhaps a higher synthesis of both viewpoints lies in higher dimen- \\nsions. Geometry, almost by definition, cannot fit the usual reductionist \\nmode. By studying a tiny strand of fiber, we cannot possibly understand \\nan entire tapestry. Similarly, by isolating a microscopic region of a sur- \\nface, we cannot determine the overall structure of the surface. Higher \\ndimensions, by definition, imply that we must take the larger, global \\nviewpoint. \\n\\nSimilarly, geometry is not purely holistic, either. Simply observing \\nthat a higher-dimensional surface is spherical does not provide the infor- \\nmation necessary to calculate the properties of the quarks contained \\nwithin it. The precise way in which a dimension curls up into a ball \\ndetermines the nature of the symmetries of the quarks and gluons living \\n\\n\\n\\n322 \\n\\n\\nMASTERS OF HYPERSPACE \\n\\n\\non that surface. Thus holism by itself does not give us the data necessary \\nto turn the ten-dimensional theory into a physically relevant theory. \\n\\nThe geometry of higher dimensions, in some sense, forces us to real- \\nize the unity between the holistic and reductionist approaches. They are \\nsimply two ways of approaching the same thing: geometry. They are two \\nsides of the same coin. From the vantage point of geometry, it makes no \\ndifference whether we approach it from the reductionist point of view \\n(assembling quarks and gluons in a Kaluza-Klein space) or the holistic \\napproach (taking a Kaluza-Klein surface and discovering the symmetries \\nof the quarks and gluons). \\n\\nWe may prefer one approach over the other, but this is only for \\nhistorical or pedagogical purposes. For historical reasons, we may stress \\nthe reductionist roots of subatomic physics, emphasizing how particle \\nphysicists over a period of 40 years pieced together three of the funda- \\nmental forces by smashing atoms, or we may take a more holistic \\napproach and claim that the final unification of quantum forces with \\ngravity implies a deep understanding of geometry. This leads us to \\napproach particle physics through Kaluza-Klein and string theories and \\nto view the Standard Model as a consequence of curling up higher- \\ndimensional space. \\n\\nThe two approaches are equally valid. In our book Beyond Einstein: \\nThe Cosmic Quest for the Theory of the Universe, Jennifer Trainer and I took \\na more reductionist approach and described how the discoveries ofphe- \\nnomena in the visible universe eventually led to a geometric description \\nof matter. In this book, we took the opposite approach, beginning with \\nthe invisible universe and taking the concept of how the laws of nature \\nsimplify in higher dimensions as our basic theme. However, both \\napproaches yield the same result. \\n\\nBy analogy, we can discuss the controversy over the \"left\" brain and \\n\"right\" brain. The neurologists who originally made the experimental \\ndiscovery that the left and right hemispheres of our brain perform dis- \\ntinctly different functions became distressed that their data were grossly \\nmisrepresented in the popular press. Experimentally, they found that \\nwhen someone is shown a picture, the left eye (or right brain) pays more \\nattention to particular details, while the right eye (or left brain) more \\neasily grasps the entire photo. However, they became disturbed when \\npopularizers began to say that the left brain was the \"holistic brain\" and \\nthe right brain was the \"reductionist brain.\" This took the distinction \\nbetween the two brains out of context, resulting in many bizarre inter- \\npretations of how one should organize one\\'s thoughts in daily life. \\n\\nA more correct approach to brain function, they found, was that the \\n\\n\\n\\nConclusion \\n\\n\\n323 \\n\\n\\nbrain necessarily uses both halves in synchrony, that the dialectic \\nbetween both halves of the brain is more important than the specific \\nfunction of each half individually. The truly interesting dynamics take \\nplace when both halves of the brain interact in harmony. \\n\\nSimilarly, anyone who sees the victory of one philosophy over the \\nother in recent advances in physics is perhaps reading too much into \\nthe experimental data. Perhaps the safest conclusion that we can reach \\nis that science benefits most from the intense interaction between these \\ntwo philosophies. \\n\\nLet us see concretely how this takes place, analyzing how the theory \\nof higher dimensions gives us a resolution between diametrically \\nopposed philosophies, using two examples, Schrodinger\\'s cat and the S \\nmatrix theory. \\n\\n\\nSchrodinger\\'s Cat \\n\\nThe disciples of holism sometimes attack reductionism by hitting quan- \\ntum theory where it is weakest, on the question of Schrodinger\\'s cat. \\nThe reductionists cannot give a reasonable explanation of the paradoxes \\nof quantum mechanics. \\n\\nThe most embarrassing feature of quantum theory, we recall, is that \\nan observer is necessary to make a measurement. Thus before the obser- \\nvation is made, cats can be either dead or alive and the moon may or \\nmay not be in the sky. Usually, this would be considered crazy, but quan- \\ntum mechanics has been verified repeatedly in the laboratory. Since the \\nprocess of making an observation requires an observer, and since an \\nobserver requires consciousness, then the disciples of holism claim that \\na cosmic consciousness must exist in order to explain the existence of \\nany object. \\n\\nHigher-dimensional theories do not resolve this difficult question \\ncompletely, but they certainly put it in a new light. The problem lies in \\nthe distinction between the observer and the observed. However, in \\nquantum gravity we write down the wave function of the entire universe. \\nThere is no more distinction between the observer and the observed; \\nquantum gravity allows for the existence of only the wave function of \\neverything. \\n\\nIn the past, such statements were meaningless because quantum grav- \\nity did not really exist as a theory. Divergences would crop up every time \\nsomeone wanted to do a physically relevant calculation. So the concept \\nofa wave function for the entire universe, although appealing, was mean- \\n\\n\\n\\n324 \\n\\n\\nMASTERS OF HYPERSPACE \\n\\n\\ningless. However, with the coming of the ten-dimensional theory, the \\nmeaning of the wave function of the entire universe becomes a relevant \\nconcept once again. Calculations with the wave function of the universe \\ncan appeal to the fact that the theory is ultimately a ten-dimensional \\ntheory, and is hence renormalizable. \\n\\nThis partial solution to the question of observation once again takes \\nthe best of both philosophies. On the one hand, this picture is reduc- \\ntionist because it adheres closely to the standard quantum-mechanical \\nexplanation of reality, without recourse to consciousness. On the other \\nhand, it is also holistic because it begins with the wave function of the \\nentire universe, which is the ultimate holistic expression! This picture \\ndoes not make the distinction between the observer and the observed. \\nIn this picture, everything, including all objects and their observers, is \\nincluded in the wave function. \\n\\nThis is still only a partial solution because the cosmic wave function \\nitself, which describes the entire universe, does not live in any definite \\nstate, but is actually a composite of all possible universes. Thus the prob- \\nlem of indeterminacy, first discovered by Heisenberg, is now extended \\nto the entire universe. \\n\\nThe smallest unit that one can manipulate in these theories is the \\nuniverse itself, and the smallest unit that one can quantize is the space \\nof all possible universes, which includes both dead cats and live cats. \\nThus in one universe, the cat is indeed dead; but in another, the cat is \\nalive. However, both universes reside in the same home: the wave func- \\ntion of the universe. \\n\\n\\nA Child of 5-Matrix Theory \\n\\nIronically, in the 1960s, the reductionist approach looked like a failure; \\nthe quantum theory of fields was hopelessly riddled with divergences \\nfound in the perturbation expansion. With quantum physics in disarray, \\na branch of physics called S-matrix (scattering matrix) theory broke off \\nfrom the mainstream and began to germinate. Originally founded by \\nHeisenberg, it was further developed by Geoffrey Chew at the University \\nof California at Berkeley. S-matrix theory, unlike reductionism, tried to \\nlook at the scattering of particles as an inseparable, irreducible whole. \\n\\nIn principle, if we know the S matrix, we know everything about \\nparticle interactions and how they scatter. In this approach, how parti- \\ncles bump into one another is everything; the individual particle is noth- \\ning. S-matrix theory said that the self-consistency of the scattering matrix. \\n\\n\\n\\nConclusion \\n\\n\\n325 \\n\\n\\nand self-consistency alone, was sufficient to determine the S matrix. Thus \\nfundamental particles and fields were banished forever from the Eden \\nof S-matrix theory. In the final analysis, only the S matrix had any phys- \\nical meaning. \\n\\nAs an analogy, let us say that we are given a complex, strange-looking \\nmachine and are asked to explain what it does. The reductionist will \\nimmediately get a screw driver and take the machine apart. By breaking \\ndown the machine to thousands of tiny pieces, the reductionist hopes \\nto find out how the machine functions. However, if the machine is too \\ncomplicated, taking it apart only makes matters worse. \\n\\nThe holists, however, do not want to take the machine apart for \\nseveral reasons. First, analyzing thousands of gears and screws may not \\ngive us the slightest hint ofwhat the overall machine does. Second, trying \\nto explain how each tiny gear works may send us on a wild-goose chase. \\nThe correct way, they feel, is to look at the machine as a whole. They \\nturn the machine on and ask how the parts move and interact with one \\nanother. In modern language, this machine is the S matrix, and this \\nphilosophy became the S-matrix theory. \\n\\nIn 1971, however, the tide shifted dramatically in favor of reduction- \\nism with Gerard \\'t Hooft\\'s discovery that the Yang-Mills field can provide \\na self-consistent theory of subatomic forces. Suddenly, each of the par- \\nticle interactions came tumbling down like huge trees in a forest. The \\nYang-Mills field gave uncanny agreement with the experimental data \\nfrom atom smashers, leading to the establishment of the Standard \\nModel, while S-matrix theory became entangled in more and more \\nobscure mathematics. By the late 1970s, it seemed like a total, irrevers- \\nible victory of reductionism over holism and the S-matrix theory. The \\nreductionists began to declare victory over the prostrate body of the \\nholists and the S matrix. \\n\\nThe tide, however, shifted once again in the 1980s. With the failure \\nof the GUTs to yield any insight into gravitation or yield any experimen- \\ntally verifiable results, physicists began to look for new avenues of \\nresearch. This departure from GUTs began with a new theory, which \\nowed its existence to the S-matrix theory. \\n\\nIn 1968, when S-matrix theory was in its heyday, Veneziano and \\nSuzuki were deeply influenced by the philosophy of determining the S \\nmatrix in its entirety. They hit on the Euler beta function because they \\nwere searching for a mathematical representation of the entire S matrix. \\nIf they had looked for reductionist Feynman diagrams, they never would \\nhave stumbled on one of the great discoveries of the past several decades. \\n\\nTwenty years later, we see the flowering of the seed planted by the \\n\\n\\n\\n326 \\n\\n\\nMASTERS OF HYPERSPACE \\n\\n\\nS-matrix theory. The Veneziano-Suzuki theory gave birth to string the- \\nory, which in turn has been reinterpreted via Kaluza-Klein as a ten- \\ndimensional theory of the universe. \\n\\nThus we see that the ten-dimensional theory straddles both \\ntraditions. It was born as a child ofa holistic Smatrix theory, but contains \\nthe reductionist Yang-Mills and quark theories. In essence, it has \\nmatured enough to absorb both philosophies. \\n\\n\\nTen Dimensions and Mathematics \\n\\nOne of the intriguing features of superstring theory is the level to which \\nthe mathematics has soared. No other theory known to science uses such \\npowerful mathematics at such a fundamental level. In hindsight, this is \\nnecessarily so, because any unified field theory first must absorb the \\nRiemannian geometry of Einstein\\'s theory and the Lie groups coming \\nfrom quantum field theory, and then must incorporate an even higher \\nmathematics to make them compatible. This new mathematics, which is \\nresponsible for the merger of these two theories, is topology, and it is \\nresponsible for accomplishing the seemingly impossible task of abolish- \\ning the infinities of a quantum theory of gravity. \\n\\nThe abrupt introduction of advanced mathematics into physics via \\nstring theory has caught many physicists off guard. More than one phys- \\nicists has secretly gone to the library to check out huge volumes of math- \\nematical literature to understand the ten-dimensional theory. CERN \\nphysicist John Ellis admits, \"I find myself touring through the bookshops \\ntrying to find encyclopedias of mathematics so that I can mug up on all \\nthese mathematical concepts like homology and homotopy and all this \\nsort of stuff which I never bothered to learn before!\" To those who \\nhave worried about the ever-widening split between mathematics and \\nphysics in this century, this is a gratifying, historic event in itself. \\n\\nTraditionally, mathematics and physics have been inseparable since \\nthe time of the Greeks. Newton and his contemporaries never made a \\nsharp distinction between mathematics and physics; they called them- \\nselves natural philosophers, and felt at home in the disparate worlds of \\nmathematics, physics, and philosophy. \\n\\nGauss, Riemann, and Poincare all considered physics to be of the \\nutmost importance as a source of new mathematics. Throughout the \\neighteenth and nineteenth centuries, there was extensive cross-pollina- \\ntion between mathematics and physics. But after Einstein and Poincare, \\nthe development of mathematics and physics took a sharp turn. For the \\n\\n\\n\\nConclusion \\n\\n\\n327 \\n\\n\\npast 70 years, there has been little, if any, real communication between \\nmathematicians and physicists. Mathematicians explored the topology \\nof N-dimensional space, developing new disciplines such as algebraic \\ntopology. Furthering the work of Gauss, Riemann, and Poincare, math- \\nematicians in the past century developed an arsenal ofabstract theorems \\nand corollaries that have no connection to the weak or strong forces. \\nPhysics, however, began to probe the realm of the nuclear force, using \\nthree-dimensional mathematics known in the nineteenth century. \\n\\nAll this changed with the introduction of the tenth dimension. \\nRather abruptly, the arsenal of the past century of mathematics is being \\nincorporated into the world of physics. Enormously powerful theorems \\nin mathematics, long cherished only by mathematicians, now take on \\nphysical significance. At last, it seems as though the diverging gap \\nbetween mathematics and physics will be closed. In fact, even the math- \\nematicians have been startled at the flood of new mathematics that the \\ntheory has introduced. Some distinguished mathematicians, such as Isa- \\ndore A. Singer of MIT, have stated that perhaps superstring theory \\nshould be treated as a branch of mathematics, independent of whether \\nit is physically relevant. \\n\\nNo one has the slightest inkling why mathematics and physics are so \\nintertwined. The physicist Paul A. M. Dirac, one of the founders of quan- \\ntum theory, stated that \"mathematics can lead us in a direction we would \\nnot take if we only followed up physical ideas by themselves.\" 7 \\n\\nAlfred North Whitehead, one of the greatest mathematicians of the \\npast century, once said that mathematics, at the deepest level, is insep- \\narable from physics at the deepest level. However, the precise reason for \\nthe miraculous convergence seems totally obscure. No one has even a \\nreasonable theory to explain why the two disciplines should share con- \\ncepts. \\n\\nIt is often said that \"mathematics is the language of physics.\" For \\nexample, Galileo once said, \"No one will be able to read the great book \\nof the Universe if he does not understand its language, which is that of \\nmathematics.\"\" But this begs the question of why. Furthermore, math- \\nematicians would be insulted to think that their entire discipline is being \\nreduced to mere semantics. \\n\\nEinstein, noting this relationship, remarked that pure mathematics \\nmight be one avenue to solve the mysteries of physics: \"It is my convic- \\ntion that pure mathematical construction enables us to discover the con- \\ncepts and the laws connecting them, which gives us the key to the under- \\nstanding of nature. ... In a certain sense, therefore. I hold it true that \\npure thought can grasp reality, as the ancients dreamed.\"\" Heisenberg \\n\\n\\n\\n328 \\n\\n\\nMASTERS OF HYPERSPACE \\n\\n\\nechoed this belief: \"If nature leads us to mathematical forms of great \\nsimplicity and beauty . . . that no one has previously encountered, we \\ncannot help thinking that they are \\'true,\\' that they reveal a genuine \\nfeature of nature . \" \\n\\nNobel laureate Eugene Wigner once even penned an essay with the \\ncandid title \"The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Nat- \\nural Sciences.\" \\n\\n\\nPhysical Principles versus Logical Structures \\n\\nOver the years, I have observed that mathematics and physics have \\nobeyed a certain dialectical relationship. Physics is notjust an aimless, \\nrandom sequence of Feynman diagrams and symmetries, and mathe- \\nmatics is notjust a set of messy equations, but rather physics and math- \\nematics obey a definite symbiotic relationship. \\n\\nPhysics, I believe, is ultimately based on a small set of physical princi- \\nples. These principles can usually be expressed in plain English without \\nreference to mathematics. From the Copernican theory, to Newton\\'s \\nlaws of motion, and even Einstein\\'s relativity, the basic physical princi- \\nples can be expressed injust a few sentences, largely independent of any \\nmathematics. Remarkably, only a handful of fundamental physical prin- \\nciples are sufficient to summarize most of modern physics. \\n\\nMathematics, by contrast, is the set of all possible self-consistent struc- \\ntures, and there are vastly many more logical structures than physical \\nprinciples. The hallmark of any mathematical system (for example, arith- \\nmetic, algebra, or geometry) is that its axioms and theorems are consis- \\ntent with one another. Mathematicians are mainly concerned that these \\nsystems never result in a contradiction, and are less interested in dis- \\ncussing the relative merits of one system over another. Any self-consistent \\nstructure, of which there are many, is worthy of study. As a result, math- \\nematicians are much more fragmented than physicists; mathematicians \\nin one area usually work in isolation from mathematicians in other areas. \\n\\nThe relationship between physics (based on physical principles) and \\nmathematics (based on self-consistent structures) is now evident: To \\nsolve a physical principle, physicists may require many self-consistent \\nstructures. Thus physics automatically unites many diverse branches of math- \\nematics. Viewed in this light, we can understand how the great ideas in \\ntheoretical physics evolved. For example, both mathematicians and phys- \\nicists claim Isaac Newton as one of the giants of their respective profes- \\nsions. However, Newton did not begin the study of gravitation starting \\nwith mathematics. By analyzing the motion of falling bodies, he was led \\n\\n\\n\\nConclusion \\n\\n\\n329 \\n\\n\\nto believe that the moon was continually falling toward the earth, but \\nnever collided with it because the earth curved beneath it; the curvature \\nof the earth compensated for the falling of the moon. He was therefore \\nled to postulate a physical principle: the universal law of gravitation. \\n\\nHowever, because he was at a loss to solve the equations for gravity, \\nNewton began a 30-year quest to construct from scratch a mathematics \\npowerful enough to calculate them. In the process, he discovered many \\nself-consistent structures, which are collectively called calculus. From this \\nviewpoint, the physical principle came first (law of gravitation), and then \\ncame the construction of diverse self-consistent structures necessary to \\nsolve it (such as analytic geometry, differential equations, derivatives, \\nand integrals). In the process, the physical principle united these diverse \\nself-consistent structures into a coherent body of mathematics (the cal- \\nculus). \\n\\nThe same relationship applies to Einstein\\'s theory of relativity. Ein- \\nstein began with physical principles (such as the constancy of the speed \\nof light and the equivalence principle for gravitation) and then, by \\nsearching through the mathematical literature, found the self-consistent \\nstructures (Lie groups, Riemann\\'s tensor calculus, differential geome- \\ntry) that allowed him to solve these principles. In the process, Einstein \\ndiscovered how to link these branches of mathematics into a coherent \\npicture. \\n\\nString theory also demonstrates this pattern, but in a startlingly dif- \\nferent fashion. Because of its mathematical complexity, string theory has \\nlinked vastly different branches of mathematics (such as Riemann sur- \\nfaces, Kac-Moody algebras, super Lie algebras, finite groups, modular \\nfunctions, and algebraic topology) in a way that has surprised the math- \\nematicians. As with other physical theories, it automatically reveals the \\nrelationship among many different self-consistent structures. However, \\nthe underlying physical principle behind string theory is unknown. Phys- \\nicists hope that once this principle is revealed, new branches of mathe- \\nmatics will be discovered in the process. In other words, the reason why \\nthe string theory cannot be solved is that twenty-first-century mathemat- \\nics has not yet been discovered. \\n\\nOne consequence of this formulation is that a physical principle that \\nunites many smaller physical theories must automatically unite many \\nseemingly unrelated branches of mathematics. This is precisely what \\nstring theory accomplishes. In fact, of all physical theories, string theory \\nunites by far the largest number of branches of mathematics into a single \\ncoherent picture. Perhaps one of the by-products of the physicists\\' quest \\nfor unification will be the unification of mathematics as well. \\n\\nOf course, the set of logically consistent mathematical structures is \\n\\n\\n\\n330 \\n\\n\\nMASTERS OF HYPERSPACE \\n\\n\\nmany times larger than the set of physical principles. Therefore, some \\nmathematical structures, such as number theory (which some mathe- \\nmaticians claim to be the purest branch of mathematics), have never \\nbeen incorporated into any physical theory. Some argue that this situa- \\ntion may always exist: Perhaps the human mind will always be able to \\nconceive of logically consistent structures that cannot be expressed \\nthrough any physical principle. However, there are indications that \\nstring theory may soon incorporate number theory into its structure as \\nwell. \\n\\n\\nScience and Religion \\n\\nBecause the hyperspace theory has opened up new, profound links \\nbetween physics and abstract mathematics, some people have accused \\nscientists of creating a new theology based on mathematics; that is, we \\nhave rejected the mythology of religion, only to embrace an even \\nstranger religion based on curved space-time, particle symmetries, and \\ncosmic expansions. While priests may chant incantations in Latin that \\nhardly anyone understands, physicists chant arcane superstring equa- \\ntions that even fewer understand. The \"faith\" in an all-powerful God is \\nnow replaced by \"faith\" in quantum theory and general relativity. When \\nscientists protest that our mathematical incantations can be checked in \\nthe laboratory, the response is that Creation cannot be measured in the \\nlaboratory, and hence these abstract theories like the superstring can \\nnever be tested. \\n\\nThis debate is not new. Historically, scientists have often been asked \\nto debate the laws of nature with theologians. For example, the great \\nBritish biologist Thomas Huxley was the foremost defender of Darwin\\'s \\ntheory of natural selection against the church\\'s criticisms in the late \\nnineteenth century. Similarly, quantum physicists have appeared on \\nradio debates with representatives of the Catholic Church concerning \\nwhether the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle negates free will, a ques- \\ntion that may determine whether our souls will enter heaven or hell. \\n\\nBut scientists usually are reluctant to engage in theological debates \\nabout God and Creation. One problem, I have found, is that \"God\" \\nmeans many things to many people, and the use of loaded words full of \\nunspoken, hidden symbolism only clouds the issue. To clarify this prob- \\nlem somewhat, I have found it useful to distinguish carefully between \\ntwo types of meanings for the word God. It is sometimes helpful to dif- \\nferentiate between the God of Miracles and the God of Order. \\n\\n\\n\\nConclusion \\n\\n\\n33 \\n\\n\\nWhen scientists use the word God, they usually mean the God of \\nOrder. For example, one of the most important revelations in Einstein\\'s \\nearly childhood took place when he read his first books on science. He \\nimmediately realized that most of what he had been taught about reli- \\ngion could not possibly be true. Throughout his career, however, he \\nclung to the belief that a mysterious, divine Order existed in the uni- \\nverse. His life\\'s calling, he would say, was to ferret out his thoughts, to \\ndetermine whether he had any choice in creating the universe. Einstein \\nrepeatedly referred to this God in his writings, fondly calling him \"the \\nOld Man.\" When stumped with an intractable mathematical problem, \\nhe would often say, \"God is subtle, but not malicious.\" Most scientists, \\nit is safe to say, believe that there is some form of cosmic Order in the \\nuniverse. However, to the nonscientist, the word God almost universally \\nrefers to the God of Miracles, and this is the source of miscommunica- \\ntion between scientists and nonscientists. The God ofMiracles intervenes \\nin our affairs, performs miracles, destroys wicked cities, smites enemy \\narmies, drowns the Pharaoh\\'s troops, and avenges the pure and noble. \\n\\nIf scientists and nonscientists fail to communicate with each other \\nover religious questions, it is because they are talking past each other, \\nreferring to entirely different Gods. This is because the foundation of \\nscience is based on observing reproducible events, but miracles, by def- \\ninition, are not reproducible. They happen only once in a lifetime, if at \\nall. Therefore, the God of Miracles is, in some sense, beyond what we \\nknow as science. This is not to say that miracles cannot happen, only \\nthat they are outside what is commonly called science. \\n\\nBiologist Edward O. Wilson of Harvard University has puzzled over \\nthis question and asked whether there is any scientific reason why \\nhumans cling so fiercely to their religion. Even trained scientists, he \\nfound, who are usually perfectly rational about their scientific special- \\nization, lapse into irrational arguments to defend their religion. Fur- \\nthermore, he observes, religion has been used historically as a cover to \\nwage hideous wars and perform unspeakable atrocities against infidels \\nand heathens. The sheer ferocity of religious or holy wars, in fact, rivals \\nthe worst crime that any human has ever committed against any other. \\n\\nReligion, notes Wilson, is universally found in every human culture \\never studied on earth. Anthropologists have found that all primitive \\ntribes have an \"origin\" myth that explains where they came from. Fur- \\nthermore, this mythology sharply separates \"us\" from \"them,\" provides \\na cohesive (and often irrational) force that preserves the tribe, and sup- \\npresses divisive criticism of the leader. \\n\\nThis is not an aberration, but the norm of human society. Religion, \\n\\n\\n\\n332 \\n\\n\\nMASTERS OF HYPERSPACE \\n\\n\\nWilson theorizes, is so prevalent because it provided a definite evolu- \\ntionary advantage for those early humans who adopted it. Wilson notes \\nthat animals that hunt in packs obey the leader because a pecking order \\nbased on strength and dominance has been established. But roughly 1 \\nmillion years ago, when our apelike ancestors gradually became more \\nintelligent, individuals could rationally begin to question the power of \\ntheir leader. Intelligence, by its very nature, questions authority by rea- \\nson. and hence could be a dangerous, dissipative force on the tribe. \\nUnless there was a force to counteract this spreading chaos, intelligent \\nindividuals would leave the tribe, the tribe would fall apart, and all indi- \\nviduals would eventually die. Thus, according to Wilson, a selection pres- \\nsure was placed on intelligent apes to suspend reason and blindly obey \\nthe leader and his myths, since doing otherwise would challenge the \\ntribe\\'s cohesion. Survival favored the intelligent ape who could reason \\nrationally about tools and food gathering, but also favored the one who \\ncould suspend that reason when it threatened the tribe\\'s integrity. A \\nmythology was needed to define and preserve the tribe. \\n\\nTo Wilson, religion was a very powerful, life-preserving force for apes \\ngradually becoming more intelligent, and formed a \"glue\" that held \\nthem together. If correct, this theory would explain why so many relig- \\nions rely on \"faith\" over common sense, and why the flock is asked to \\nsuspend reason. It would also help to explain the inhuman ferocity of \\nreligious wars, and why the God of Miracles always seems to favor the \\nvictor in a bloody war. The God of Miracles has one powerful advantage \\nover the God of Order. The God of Miracles explains the mythology of \\nour purpose in the universe; on this question, the God of Order is silent. \\n\\n\\nOur Role in Nature \\n\\nAlthough the God of Order cannot give humanity a shared destiny or \\npurpose, what I find personally most astonishing about this discussion \\nis that we humans, who arejust beginning our ascent up the technolog- \\nical scale, should be capable of making such audacious claims concern- \\ning the origin and fate of the universe. \\n\\nTechnologically, we arejust beginning to leave the earth\\'s gravita- \\ntional pull; we have only begun to send crude probes to the outer plan- \\nets. Yet imprisoned on our small planet, with only our minds and a few \\ninstruments, we have been able to decipher the laws that govern matter \\nbillions of light-years away. With infinitesimally small resources, without \\neven leaving the solar system, we have been able to determine what \\n\\n\\n\\nConclusion \\n\\n\\n333 \\n\\n\\nhappens deep inside the nuclear furnaces of a star or inside the nucleus \\nitself. \\n\\nAccording to evolution, we are intelligent apes who have only \\nrecently left the trees, living on the third planet from a minor star, in a \\nminor spiral arm of a minor galaxy, in a minor group of galaxies near \\nthe Virgo supercluster. If the inflation theory is correct, then our entire \\nvisible universe is but an infinitesimal bubble in a much larger cosmos. \\nEven then, given the almost insignificant role that we play in the larger \\nuniverse, it seems amazing that we should be capable of making the \\nclaim to have discovered the theory of everything. \\n\\nNobel laureate Isidor I. Rabi was once asked what event in his life \\nfirst set him on the longjourney to discover the secrets of nature. He \\nreplied that it was when he checked out some books on the planets from \\nthe library. What fascinated him was that the human mind is capable of \\nknowing such cosmic truths. The planets and the stars are so much larger \\nthan the earth, so much more distant than anything ever visited by \\nhumans, yet the human mind is able to understand them. \\n\\nPhysicist Heinz Pagels recounted his pivotal experience when, as a \\nchild, he visited the Hayden Planetarium in New York. He recalled, \\n\\nThe drama and power of the dynamic universe overwhelmed me. I learned \\nthat single galaxies contain more stars than all the human beings who have \\never lived. . . . The reality of the immensity and duration of the universe \\ncaused a kind of \\'existential shock\\' that shook the foundations of my being. \\nEverything that I had experienced or known seemed insignificant placed \\nin that vast ocean of existence.\"\\xe2\\x80\\x99 \\n\\nInstead ofbeing overwhelmed by the universe, I think that perhaps \\none of the deepest experiences a scientist can have, almost approaching \\na religious awakening, is to realize that we are children of the stars, and \\nthat our minds are capable of understanding the universal laws that they \\nobey. The atoms within our bodies were forged on the anvil of nucleo- \\nsynthesis within an exploding star aeons before the birth of the solar \\nsystem. Our atoms are older than the mountains. We are literally made \\nof star dust. Now these atoms, in turn, have coalesced into intelligent \\nbeings capable of understanding the universal laws governing that \\nevent. \\n\\nWhat I find fascinating is that the laws of physics that we have found \\non our tiny, insignificant planet are the same as the laws found every- \\nwhere else in the universe, yet these laws were discovered without our \\never having left the earth. Without mighty starships or dimensional win- \\n\\n\\n\\n334 \\n\\n\\nMASTERS OF HYPERSPACE \\n\\n\\ndows, we have been able to determine the chemical nature of the stars \\nand decode the nuclear processes that take place deep in their cores. \\n\\nFinally, if ten-dimensional superstring theory is correct, then a civi- \\nlization thriving on the farthest star will discover precisely the same truth \\nabout our universe. It, too, will wonder about the relation between mar- \\nble and wood, and come to the conclusion that the traditional three- \\ndimensional world is \"too small\" to accommodate the known forces in \\nits world. \\n\\nOur curiosity is part of the natural order. Perhaps we as humans want \\nto understand the universe in the same way that a bird wants to sing. As \\nthe great seventeenth-century astronomer Johannes Kepler once said, \\n\"We do not ask for what useful purpose the birds do sing, for song is \\ntheir pleasure since they were created for singing. Similarly, we ought \\nnot to ask why the human mind troubles to fathom the secrets of the \\nheavens.\" Or, as the biologist Thomas H. Huxley said in 1863, \"The \\nquestion of all questions for humanity, the problem which lies behind \\nall others and is more interesting than any of them is that of the deter- \\nmination of man\\'s place in Nature and his relation to the Cosmos.\" \\n\\nCosmologist Stephen Hawking, who has spoken of solving the prob- \\nlem of unification within this century, has written eloquently about the \\nneed to explain to the widest possible audience the essential physical \\npicture underlying physics: \\n\\n[If] we do discover a complete theory, it should in time be understandable \\nin broad principle by everyone, notjust a few scientists. Then we shall all, \\nphilosophers, scientists, andjust ordinary people, be able to take part in \\nthe discussion of the question of why it is that we and the universe exist. \\n\\nIf we find the answer to that, it would be the ultimate triumph of human \\nreason \\xe2\\x80\\x94 for then we would know the mind of God.\" \\n\\nOn a cosmic scale, we are still awakening to the larger world around \\nus. Yet the power of even our limited intellect is such that we can abstract \\nthe deepest secrets of nature. \\n\\nDoes this give meaning or purpose to life? \\n\\nSome people seek meaning in life through personal gain, through \\npersonal relationships, or through personal experiences. However, it \\nseems to me that being blessed with the intellect to divine the ultimate \\nsecrets of nature gives meaning enough to life. \\n\\n\\n\\nNotes \\n\\n\\nPreface \\n\\n1. The subject is so new that there is yet no universally accepted term used \\nby theoretical physicists when referring to higher-dimensional theories. Tech- \\nnically speaking, when physicists address the theory, they refer to a specific the- \\nory, such as Kaluza-Klein theory, supergravity, or superstring, although hyperspace \\nis the term popularly used when referring to higher dimensions, and hyper- is the \\ncorrect scientific prefix for higher-dimensional geometric objects. I have \\nadhered to popular custom and used the word hyperspace to refer to higher \\ndimensions. \\n\\n\\nChapter I \\n\\n1.

This incredibly small distance will continually reappear throughout this \\nbook. It is the fundamental length scale that typifies any quantum theory of \\ngravity. The reason for this is quite simple. In any theory of gravity, the strength \\nof the gravitational force is measured by Newton\\'s constant. However, physicists \\nuse a simplified set of units where the speed of light c is set equal to one. This \\nmeans that 1 second is equivalent to 186,000 miles. Also, Planck\\'s constant \\ndivided by2piis also set equal to one, which sets a numerical relationship between \\nseconds and ergs of energy. In these strange but convenient units, everything, \\nincluding Newton\\'s constant, can be reduced to centimeters. When we calculate \\nthe length associated with Newton\\'s constant, it is precisely the Planck length, \\nor 1 0 3 3 centimeter, or 1 0 1 9 billion electron volts. Thus all quantum gravitational \\n\\n\\n335 \\n\\n\\n\\n336 \\n\\n\\nNotes \\n\\n\\neffects are measured in terms of this tiny distance. In particular, the size of these \\nunseen higher dimensions is the Planck length. \\n\\n5. Linda Dalrymple Henderson.

Years later, he would make a famous speculation about a certain \\nformula involving the zeta function in number theory. After 100 years of grap- \\npling with \"Riemann\\'s hypothesis,\" the world\\'s greatest mathematicians have \\nfailed to offer any proof. Our most advanced computers have failed to give us a \\nclue, and Riemann\\'s hypothesis has now gone down in history as one of the most \\nfamous unproven theorems in number theory, perhaps in all of mathematics. \\nBell notes, \"Whoever proves or disproves it will cover himself with glory\" (ibid., \\n488). \\n\\n3.

Although Riemann is credited as having been the driving creative force \\nwho finally shattered the confines ofEuclidean geometry, by rights, the man who \\nshould have discovered the geometry of higher dimensions was Riemann\\'s aging \\nmentor, Gauss himself. \\n\\nIn 1817, almost a decade before Riemann\\'s birth, Gauss privately expressed \\nhis deep frustration with Euclidean geometry. In a prophetic letter to his friend \\nthe astronomer Heinrich Olbers, he clearly stated that Euclidean geometry is \\nmathematically incomplete. \\n\\nIn 1869, mathematician James J. Sylvester recorded that Gauss had seriously \\nconsidered the possibility of higher-dimensional spaces. Gauss imagined the \\nproperties of beings, which he called \"bookworms,\" that could live entirely on \\ntwo-dimensional sheets of paper. He then generalized this concept to include \\n\"beings capable of realizing space of four or a greater number of dimensions \" \\n(quoted in Linda Dalrymple Henderson, The Fourth Dimension and Non-Euclidean \\nGeometry in Modern Art [Princeton. N.J.: Princeton University Press, 1983], 19). \\n\\nBut if Gauss was 40 years ahead of anyone else in formulating the theory of \\nhigher dimensions, then why did he miss this historic opportunity to shatter the \\nbonds of three-dimensional Euclidean geometry? Historians have noted Gauss\\'s \\ntendency to be conservative in his work, his politics, and his personal life. In fact, \\nhe never once left Germany, and spent almost his entire life in one city. This \\nalso affected his professional life. \\n\\nIn a revealing letter written in 1829, Gauss confessed to his friend Friedrich \\nBessel that he would never publish his work on non-Euclidean geometry for fear \\nof the controversy it would raise among the \"Boeotians.\" Mathematician Morris \\nKline wrote, \"[Gauss] said in a letter to Bessel of January 27, 1829, that he \\n\\n\\n\\nNotes \\n\\n\\n337 \\n\\n\\nprobably would never publish his findings in this subject because he feared rid- \\nicule, or as he put it, he feared the clamor ofthe Boeotians, a figurative reference \\nto a dull-witted Greek tribe\" ( Mathematics aild the Physical World [New York: Crow- \\nell, 1959], 449). Gauss was so intimidated by the old guard, the narrow-minded \\n\"Boeotians\" who believed in the sacred nature of three dimensions, that he kept \\nsecret some of his finest work. \\n\\nIn 1869, Sylvester, in an interview with Gauss\\'s biographer Sartorious von \\nWaltershausen, wrote that \"this great man used to say that he had laid aside \\nseveral questions which he had treated analytically, and hoped to apply to them \\ngeometrical methods in a future state ofexistence, when his conceptions ofspace \\nshould have become amplified and extended; for as we can conceive beings (like \\ninfinitely attenuated book-worms in an infinitely thin sheet of paper) which pos- \\nsess only the notion of space of two dimensions, so we may imagine beings capa- \\nble of realizing space of four or a greater number of dimensions\" (quoted in \\nHenderson, Fourth Dimension and Non-Euclidean Geometry in Modern Art, 19). \\n\\nGauss wrote to Olbers, \"I am becoming more and more convinced that the \\n(physical) necessity of our (Euclidean) geometry cannot be proved, at least not \\nby human reason nor for human reason. Perhaps in another life we will be able \\nto obtain insight into the nature ofspace, which is now unattainable. Until then, \\nwe must place geometry not in the same class with arithmetic, which is purely a \\npriori, but with mechanics\" (quoted in Morris Kline, Mathematical Thought from \\nAncient to Modem Times [New York: Oxford University Press, 1972], 872). \\n\\nIn fact, Gauss was so suspicious of Euclidean geometry that he even conducted \\nan ingenious experiment to test it. He and his assistants scaled three mountain \\npeaks: Rocken, Hohehagen, and Inselsberg. From each mountain peak, the \\nother two peaks were clearly visible. By drawing a triangle between the three \\npeaks, Gauss was able to experimentally measure the interior angles. IfEuclidean \\ngeometry is correct, then the angle should have summed to 180 degrees. To his \\ndisappointment, he found that the sum was exactly 180 degrees (plus or minus \\n15 minutes). The crudeness of his measuring equipment did not allow him to \\nconclusively show that Euclid was wrong. (Today, we realize that this experiment \\nwould have to be performed between three different star systems to detect a \\nsizable deviation from Euclid\\'s result.) \\n\\nWe should also point out that the mathematicians Nikolaus I. Lobachevski \\nand Janos Bolyai independently discovered the non-Euclidean mathematics \\ndefined on curved surfaces. However, their construction was limited to the usual \\nlower dimensions. \\n\\n5. Quoted in Bell, Men of Mathematics, 497. \\n\\n6. The British mathematician William Clifford, who translated Riemann\\'s \\nfamous speech for Nature in 1873, amplified many of Riemann\\'s seminal ideas \\nand was perhaps the first to expand on Riemann\\'s idea that the bending ofspace \\nis responsible for the force of electricity and magnetism, thus crystallizing Rie- \\nmann\\'s work. Clifford speculated that the two mysterious discoveries in mathe- \\nmatics (higher-dimensional spaces) and physics (electricity and magnetism) are \\n\\n\\n\\n338 \\n\\n\\nNotes \\n\\n\\nreally the same thing, that the force of electricity and magnetism is caused by \\nthe bending of higher-dimensional space. \\n\\nThis is the first time that anyone had speculated that a \"force\" is nothing but \\nthe bending of space itself, preceding Einstein by 50 years. Clifford\\'s idea that \\nelectromagnetism was caused by vibrations in the fourth dimension also pre- \\nceded the work of Theodr Kaluza, who would also attempt to explain electro- \\nmagnetism with a higher dimension. Clifford and Riemann thus anticipated the \\ndiscoveries of the pioneers of the twentieth century, that the meaning of higher- \\ndimensional space is in its ability to give a simple and elegant description of \\nforces. For the first time, someone correctly isolated the true physical meaning \\nof higher dimensions, that a theory about space actually gives us a unifying picture \\nof forces. \\n\\nThese prophetic views were recorded by mathematician James Sylvester, who \\nwrote in 1869, \"Mr. W. K Clifford has indulged in some remarkable speculations \\nas to the possibility of our being able to infer, from certain unexplained phe- \\nnomena of light and magnetism, the fact of our level space of three dimensions \\nbeing in the act of undergoing in space of four dimensions ... a distortion \\nanalogous to the rumpling of a page\" (quoted in Henderson, Fourth Dimension \\nand Non-Euclidean Geometry in Modern Art, 19). \\n\\nIn 1870, in a paper with the intriguing title \"On the Space-Theory of Matter,\" \\nhe says explicitly that \"this variation of the curvature of space is what really \\nhappens in that phenomenon which we call the motion of matter, whether pon- \\nderable or ethereal\" (William Clifford, \"On the Space-Theory of Matter,\" Pro- \\nceedings of the Cambridge Philosophical Society 2 [1876]: 157-158). \\n\\n7. More precisely, in N dimensions the Riemann metric tensor is an N X \\njtymatrix, which determines the distance between two points, such that the infin- \\nitesimal distance between two points is given by ds ! = Srfx \\'fc, d\\xc2\\xa3. In the limit \\nof flat space, the Riemann metric tensor becomes diagonal, that is, = 5 I1V , and \\nhence the formalism reduces back to the Pythagorean Theorem in N-dimensions. \\nThe deviation of the metric tensor from 8 A ,\\xe2\\x80\\x9e roughly speaking, measures the \\ndeviation of the space from flat space. From the metric tensor, we can construct \\nthe Riemann curvature tensor, represented by P? A . \\n\\nThe curvature ofspace at any given point can be measured by drawing a circle \\nat that point and measuring the area inside that circle. In flat two-dimensional \\nspace, the area inside the circle ispir 2 . However, ifthe curvature is positive, as in \\na sphere, the area is less than pi r : If the curvature is negative, as in a saddle or \\ntrumpet, the area is greater than pir : . \\n\\nStrictly speaking, by this convention, the curvature of a crumpled sheet of \\npaper is zero. This is because the areas of circles drawn on this crumpled sheet \\nof paper still equal pi r 2 . In Riemann\\'s example offorce created by the crumpling \\nof a sheet of paper, we implicitly assume that the paper is distorted and stretched \\nas well as folded, so that the curvature is nonzero. \\n\\n8.

In 1917, physicist Paul Ehrenfest, a friend ofEinstein, wrote a paper enti- \\ntled \"In What Way Does It Become Manifest in the Fundamental Laws of Physics \\nthat Space has Three Dimensions?\" Ehrenfest asked himself whether the stars \\nand planets are possible in higher dimensions. For example, the light of a candle \\ngets dimmer as we move farther away from it. Similarly, the gravitational pull of \\na star gets weaker as we go farther away. According to Newton, gravity gets weaker \\nby an inverse square law. If we double the distance away from a candle or star, \\nthe light or gravitational pull gets four times weaker. Ifwe triple the distance, it \\ngets nine times weaker. \\n\\nIf space were four dimensional, then candlelight or gravity would get weaker \\nmuch more rapidly, as the inverse cube. Doubling the distance from a candle or \\nstar would weaken the candlelight or gravity by a factor of eight. \\n\\nCan solar systems exist in such a four-dimensional world? In principle, yes, \\nbut the planets\\' orbits would not be stable. The slightest vibration would collapse \\nthe orbits of the planets. Over time, all the planets would wobble away from their \\nusual orbits and plunge into the sun. \\n\\nSimilarly, the sun would not be able to exist in higher dimensions. The force \\nof gravity tends to crush the sun. It balances out the force of fusion, which tends \\nto blow the sun apart. Thus the sun is a delicate balancing act between nuclear \\nforces that would cause it to explode and gravitational forces that would con- \\ndense it down to a point. In a higher-dimensional universe, this delicate balance \\nwould be disrupted, and stars might spontaneously collapse. \\n\\n12.

Zollner had been converted to spiritualism in 1875 when he visited the \\nlaboratory of Crookes, the discoverer of the element thalium, inventor of the \\ncathode ray tube, and editor of the learned Quarterly Journal of Science. Crookes\\'s \\ncathode ray tube revolutionized science; anyone who watches television, uses \\na computer monitor, plays a video game, or has been x-rayed owes a debt to \\nCrookes\\'s famous invention. \\n\\nCrookes, in turn, was no crank. In fact, he was a lion of British scientific \\nsociety, with a wall full of professional honors. He was knighted in 1897 and \\nreceived the Order ofMerit in 1910. His deep interest in spiritualism was sparked \\nby the tragic death of his brother Philip of yellow fever in 1867. He became a \\nprominent member (and later president) of the Society for Psychical Research, \\nwhich included an astonishing number of important scientists in the late nine- \\nteenth century. \\n\\n14.

To imagine how knots can be unraveled in dimensions beyond three, \\nimagine two rings that are intertwined. Now take a two-dimensional cross section \\nof this configuration, such that one ring lies on this plane while the other ring \\nbecomes a point (because it lies perpendicular to the plane). We now have a \\npoint inside a circle. In higher dimensions, we have the freedom of moving this \\n\\n\\n\\n340 \\n\\n\\nNotes \\n\\n\\ndot completely outside the circle without cutting any of the rings. This means \\nthat the two rings have now completely separated, as desired. This means that \\nknots in dimensions higher than three can always be untied because there is \\n\"enough room.\" But also notice that we cannot remove the dot from the ring \\nif we are in three-dimensional space, which is the reason why knots stay knotted \\nonly in the third dimension. \\n\\n\\nChapter 3 \\n\\n1. A. T.

Lenin\\'s Materialism and Empiro-Criticism is important today because it deeply \\naffected modern Soviet and Eastern European science. For example, Lenin\\'s \\ncelebrated phrase \"the inexhaustibility of the electron\" signified the dialectical \\nnotion that we find new sublayers and contradictions whenever we probe deeply \\ninto the heart of matter. For example, galaxies are composed of smaller star \\nsystems, which in turn contain planets, which are composed of molecules, which \\nare made of atoms, which contain electrons, which, in turn, are \"inexhaustible.\" \\nThis is a variation of the \"worlds within worlds\" theory. \\n\\n7.

To a Flatlander, the squares are rigid. They cannot be twisted \\nor rotated along any of the sides connecting the squares. Now imagine, however, \\nthat we grab the squares and decide to fold up the series of squares, forming a \\ncube. Thejoints connecting the squares, which were rigid in two dimensions, \\ncan be easily folded in three dimensions. In fact, the folding operation can be \\nperformed smoothly without a Flatlander even noticing that the folding is taking \\nplace. \\n\\nNow, ifa Flatlander were inside the cube, he would notice a surprising thing. \\nEach square leads to another square. There is no \"outside\" to the cube. Each \\ntime a Flatlander moves from one square to the next, he smoothly (without his \\nknowledge) bends 90 degrees in the third dimension and enters the next square. \\nFrom the outside, the house isjust an ordinary square. However, to someone \\nentering the square, he would find a bizarre sequence of squares, each square \\nleading impossibly to the next square. To him, it would seem impossible that the \\ninterior of a single square could house a series of six squares. \\n\\n\\nChapter 4 \\n\\n1.

Normally, it is absurd to think that two people can each be taller than the \\nother. However, in this situation we have two people, each correctly thinking \\nthat the other has been compressed. This is not a true contradiction because it \\ntakes time in which to perform a measurement, and time as well as space has \\nbeen distorted. In particular, events that appear simultaneous in one frame are \\nnot simultaneous when viewed in another frame. \\n\\nFor example, let\\'s say that people on the platform take out a ruler and, as the \\ntrain passes by, drop the measuring stick onto the platform. As the train goes by, \\nthey drop the two ends of the stick so that the ends hit the platform simulta- \\nneously. In this way, they can prove that the entire length of the compressed \\ntrain, from front to back, is only 1 foot long. \\n\\nNow consider the same measuring process from the point of view of the pas- \\nsengers on the train. They think they are at rest and see the compressed subway \\nstation coming toward them, with compressed people about to drop a com- \\npressed ruler onto the platform. At first it seems impossible that such a tiny ruler \\nwould be able to measure the entire length of the train. However, when the ruler \\nis dropped, the ends of the ruler do not hit the floor simultaneously. One end \\nof the ruler hits the floorjust as the station goes by the front end of the train. \\nOnly when the station has moved completely by the length of the entire train \\ndoes the second end of the ruler finally hit the floor. In this way, the same ruler \\nhas measured the entire length of the train in either frame. \\n\\nThe essence of this \"paradox,\" and many others that appear in relativity \\n\\n\\n\\n342 \\n\\n\\nNote \\n\\n\\ntheory, is that the measuring process takes time, and that both space and time \\nbecome distorted in different ways in different frames. \\n\\n4.

Therefore, there are eight equations in Maxwell\\'s equations. \\n\\nWe can rewrite these equations relativistically. If we introduce the Maxwell \\ntensor F\\xe2\\x80\\x9e = d^i, - d/ 4 A , then these equations reduce to one equation: \\n\\nw = j- \\n\\nwhich is the relativistic version of Maxwell\\'s equations. \\n\\n5.

A hypersphere can be defined in much the same way as a circle or sphere. \\nA circle is defined as the set of points that satisfy the equation x ! +y2 = r in the \\nx-y plane.

In 1914, even before Einstein proposed his theory of general relativity, \\n\\n\\n\\nNotes \\n\\n\\n343 \\n\\n\\nphysicist Gunnar Nordstrom tried to unify electromagnetism with gravity by \\nintroducing a five-dimensional Maxwell theory. If one examines his theory, one \\nfinds that it correctly contains Maxwell\\'s theory of light in four dimensions, but \\nit is a scalar theory of gravity, which is known to be incorrect. As a consequence, \\nNordstrom\\'s ideas were largely forgotten. In some sense, he published too soon. \\nHis paper was written 1 year before Einstein\\'s theory of gravity was published, \\nand hence it was impossible for him to write down a five-dimensional Einstein- \\ntype theory of gravity. \\n\\nKaluza\\'s theory, in contrast to Nordstrom\\'s, began with a metric tensor g,, \\ndefined in five-dimensional space. Then Kaluza identified with the Maxwell \\ntensor A A . The old four-dimensional Einstein metric was then identified by Kalu- \\nza\\'s new metric only if p, and v did not equal 5. In this simple but elegant way, \\nboth the Einstein field and the Maxwell field were placed inside Kaluza\\'s five- \\ndimensional metric tensor. \\n\\nAlso, apparendy Heinrich Mandel and Gustav Mie proposed five-dimensional \\ntheories. Thus the fact that higher dimensions were such a dominant aspect of \\npopular culture probably helped to cross-pollinate the world of physics. In this \\nsense, the work of Riemann was coming full circle. \\n\\n14. Peter Freund, interview with author, 1990. \\n\\n15. Ibid. \\n\\n\\nChapter 5 \\n\\n1. Quoted in K. C.

However, the counterpart \\nof the equivalence principle for string theory has not yet been found. \\n\\nAs Witten points out, \"It\\'s been clear that string theory does, in fact, give a \\nlogically consistent framework, encompassing both gravity and quantum \\nmechanics. At the same time, the conceptual framework in which this should be \\nproperly understood, analogous to the principle of equivalence that Einstein \\nfound in his theory of gravity, hasn\\'t yet emerged\" (ibid., 97). \\n\\nThis is why, at present, Witten is formulating what are called topological field \\ntheories \\xe2\\x80\\x94 that is, theories that are totally independent of the way we measure \\ndistances. The hope is that these topological field theories may correspond to \\nsome \"unbroken phase of string theory\" \\xe2\\x80\\x94 that is, string theory beyond the \\nPlanck length. \\n\\n7.

Let us examine compactification in terms of the full heterotic string, which \\nhas two kinds of vibrations: one vibrating in the full 26-dimensional space-time, \\nand the other in the usual ten-dimensional space time. Since 26 \\xe2\\x80\\x94 10 \\xe2\\x80\\x94 16, we \\nnow assume that 16 of the 26 dimensions have curled up \\xe2\\x80\\x94 that is, \"com- \\n\\n\\n\\nNotes \\n\\n\\n345 \\n\\n\\npactified\" into some manifold \\xe2\\x80\\x94 leaving us with a ten-dimensional theory. Any- \\none walking along any of these 16 directions will wind up precisely at the same \\nspot. \\n\\nIt was Peter Freund who suggested that the symmetry group of this 16-dimen- \\nsional compactified space was the group E(8) X E(8). A quick check shows that \\nthis symmetry is vastly larger and includes the symmetry group of the Standard \\nModel, given by SU(3) X SU(2) X U(l). \\n\\nIn summary, the key relation is 26 \\xe2\\x80\\x94 10 = 16, which means that if we com- \\npactify 16 of the original 26 dimensions of the heterotic string, we are left with \\na 16-dimensional compact space with a leftover symmetry called E(8) X E(8). \\nHowever, in Kaluza-Klein theory, when a particle is forced to live on a compac- \\ntified space, it must necessarily inherit the symmetry of that space. This means \\nthat the vibrations of the string must rearrange themselves according to the \\nsymmetry group E(8) X E(8). \\n\\nAs a result, we can conclude that group theory reveals to us that this group is \\nmuch larger than the symmetry group appearing in the Standard Model, and \\ncan thus include the Standard Model as a small subset of the ten-dimensional \\ntheory. \\n\\n10. Although the supergravity theory is defined in 11 dimensions, the theory \\nis still too small to accommodate all particle interactions. The largest symmetry \\ngroup for supergravity is 0(8), which is too small to accommodate the Standard \\nModel\\'s symmetries. \\n\\nAt first, it appears that the 11-dimensional supergravity has more dimensions, \\nand hence more symmetry, than the ten-dimensional superstring. This is an illu- \\nsion because the heterotic string begins by compactifying 26-dimensional space \\ndown to ten-dimensional space, leaving us with 16 compactified dimensions, \\nwhich yields the group E(8) X E(8). This is more than enough to accommodate \\nthe Standard Model. \\n\\n11. Witten, Interview, in Superstrings, ed. Davies and Brown, 102. \\n\\n12. Note that other alternative nonperturbati ve approaches to string theory \\nhave been proposed, but they are not as advanced as string field theory. The \\nmost ambitious is \"universal moduli space,\" which tries to analyze the properties \\nof string surfaces with an infinite number of holes in them. (Unfortunately, no \\none knows how to calculate with this kind of surface.) Another is the renormal- \\nization group method, which can so far reproduce only surfaces without any \\nholes (tree-type diagrams). There is also the matrix models, which so far can be \\ndefined only in two dimensions or less. \\n\\n13. To understand this mysterious factor of two, consider a light beam that \\nhas two physical modes of vibration. Polarized light can vibrate, say, either hor- \\nizontally or vertically. However, a relativistic Maxwell field has four compo- \\nnents, where u. = 1,2, 3, 4. We are allowed to subtract two of these four compo- \\nnents using the gauge symmetry of Maxwell\\'s equations. Since 4 - 2 = 2, the \\noriginal four Maxwell fields have been reduced by two. Similarly, a relativistic \\nstring vibrates in 26 dimensions. However, two of these vibratory modes can be \\n\\n\\n\\n346 \\n\\n\\nNotes \\n\\n\\nremoved when we break the symmetry of the string, leaving us with 24 vibratory \\nmodes, which are the ones that appear in the Ramanujan function. \\n\\n14.

The orbifold theory is actually the creation ofseveral individuals, including \\nL. Dixon, J. Harvey, and Edward Witten of Princeton. \\n\\n4. Years ago, mathematicians asked themselves a simple question: Given a \\ncurved surface in N-dimensional space, how many kinds of vibrations can exist \\non it? For example, think ofpouring sand on a drum. When the drum is vibrated \\nat a certain frequency, the particles of sands dance on the drum surface and \\nform beautiful symmetrical patterns. Different patterns of sand particles corre- \\nspond to different frequencies allowed on the drum surface. Similarly, mathe- \\nmaticians have calculated the number and kind of resonating vibrations allowed \\non the surface of a curved N-dimensional surface. They even calculated the \\nnumber and kind ofvibrations that an electron could have on such a hypothetical \\nsurface. To the mathematicians, this was a cute intellectual exercise. No one \\nthought it could possibly have any physical consequence. After all, electrons, they \\nthought, don\\'t vibrate on N-dimensional surfaces. \\n\\nThis large body of mathematical theorems can now be brought to bear on \\nthe problem of GUT families. Each GUT family, if string theory is correct, must \\nbe a reflection of some vibration on an orbifold. Since the various kinds ofvibra- \\ntions have been cataloged by mathematicians, all physicists have to do is look in \\na math book to tell them how many identical families there are! Thus the origin \\nof the family problem is topology. If string theory is correct, the origin of these \\nthree duplicate families of GUT particles cannot be understood unless we \\nexpand our consciousness to ten dimensions. \\n\\nOnce we have curled up the unwanted dimensions into a tiny ball, we can \\nthen compare the theory with experimental data. For example, the lowest exci- \\ntation of the string corresponds to a closed string with a very small radius. The \\nparticles that occur in the vibration of a small closed string are precisely those \\nfound in supergravity. Thus we retrieve all the good results of supergravity, with- \\nout the bad results. The symmetry group of this new supergravity is E(8) X E(8), \\nwhich is much larger than the symmetry of the Standard Model or even the GUT \\ntheory. Therefore, the superstring contains both the GUT and the supergravity \\ntheory (without many of the bad features of either theory). Instead of wiping \\nout its rivals, the superstring simply eats them up. \\n\\nThe problem with these orbifolds, however, is that we can construct hundreds \\nof thousands of them. We have an embarrassment of riches! Each one of them, \\nin principle, describes a consistent universe. How do we tell which universe is \\nthe correct one? Among these thousands of solutions, we find many that predict \\nexactly three generations or families of quarks and leptons. We can also predict \\nthousands of solutions where there are many more than three generations. Thus \\nwhile GUTs consider three generations to be too many, many solutions of string \\ntheory consider three generations to be too few! \\n\\n5.

More precisely, the Pauli exclusion principle states that no two electrons \\ncan occupy the same quantum state with the same quantum numbers. This \\nmeans that a white dwarf can be approximated as a Fermi sea, or a gas of elec- \\ntrons obeying the Pauli principle. \\n\\nSince electrons cannot be in the same quantum state, a net repulsive force \\nprevents them from being compressed down to a point. In a white dwarf star, it \\nis this repulsive force that ultimately counteracts the gravitational force. \\n\\nThe same logic applies to neutrons in a neutron star, since neutrons also obey \\nthe Pauli exclusion principle, although the calculation is more complicated \\nbecause of other nuclear and general relativistic effects. \\n\\n2.
